<a name="task-connectorconnectionpooladvance"></a><h3>To Edit Connector Connection Pool Advanced Attributes</h3><a name="indexterm-6"></a><ol>
<li><b>In the navigation tree, expand the Resources node.</b></li>
<li><b>Expand the Connectors node.</b></li>
<li><b>Under the Connectors node, select the Connector Connection Pools node.</b><p>The Connector Connection Pools page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>On the Connector Connection Pools page, click the name of the connector connection
pool that you are editing.</b><p>The Edit Connector Connection Pool page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>On the Edit Connector Connection Pool page, click the Advanced tab.</b><p>The Edit Connector Connection Pool Advanced Attributes page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Validate At Most Once field, type the amount of time,
in seconds, after which a connection is validated at most once.</b><p>Setting this attribute to an appropriate value minimizes the number of validation requests by
a connection. Default value is 0, which means that the attribute is not
enabled.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Leak Timeout field, type the amount of time, in seconds, to
trace connection leaks in a connection pool.</b><p>A value of 0 indicates that connection leak tracing is disabled. The default
value is 0.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Leak Reclaim checkbox to enable leaked connections to be restored to
the pool after leak connection tracing is complete.</b><p>This option is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Creation Retry Attempts field, type the number of attempts that will
be made if there is a failure in creating a new connection.</b><p>A value of 0 indicates that no attempts will be made to
create the connection again. The default value is 0.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Retry Interval field, type the interval, in seconds, between two attempts
to create a connection.</b><p>This attribute is used only if the value of Creation Retry Attempts is
greater than 0. The default value is 10 seconds.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Pooling checkbox to enable connection pooling for the pool.</b><p>This option is enabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Lazy Association checkbox to enable connections to be lazily associated when
an operation is performed on them.</b><p>The connections are disassociated when the transaction is completed and a component method ends,
which helps reuse of the physical connections. This option is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Lazy Connection Enlistment checkbox to enlist a resource to the transaction
only when it is actually used in a method.</b><p>This option is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Associate with Thread checkbox to associate a connection with a thread.</b><p>When the same thread is in need of a connection, it can reuse
the connection already associated with it, thereby not incurring the overhead of getting
a connection from the pool. This option is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Match Connections checkbox to enable connection matching for the pool.</b><p>Disable this option if you know that the connections in the pool will
always be homogeneous and hence a connection picked from the pool need not
be matched by the resource adapter. This option is enabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Match Connection Usage field, type the number of times a connection
should be reused by the pool.</b><p>Once a connection is reused for the specified number of times, it will
be closed. A value of 0 indicates that this attribute is not enabled.
The default value is 0.</p></li>
<li><b>Click Save.</b>
<hr><p><b>Tip - </b>To return to the default settings, click the Load Defaults button, then click
Save.</p>
