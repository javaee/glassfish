<a name="ref-redeploy"></a><h4>Redeploy Applications or Modules</h4>
<a name="indexterm-184"></a><a name="indexterm-185"></a><p>Use the Redeploy Applications or Modules page to redeploy a previously deployed application.</p>

<p>The Redeploy Applications or Modules page contains the following options.</p>

<dl><dt>Location</dt>
<dd><p>The location of the new archive for the application that you are redeploying.</p>

<p>The following options specify from where the archive is accessible and whether the archive is a file or a directory.</p>

<dl><dt>Packaged File to Be Uploaded to the Server</dt>
<dd><p>The archive is in a file that resides on or is accessible from the client machine.</p>

<p>The client machine is the host on which you are viewing the Administration Console through a browser.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Local Packaged File or Directory That Is Accessible From the GlassFish Server</dt>
<dd><p>The archive is a file that resides on the server machine, or is an unpackaged application in an exploded directory.</p>

<p>The server machine is the host that is running the GlassFish Server domain administration server. </p>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Application Name</dt>
<dd><p>Read-only field displaying the name of the application that you are redeploying.</p>

<p>The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows the name and is separated from the name by a colon (<tt>:</tt>). For more information about module and application versions, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/821-2417/gkhhv?a=view">Module and Application Versions in <i>Oracle GlassFish Server 3.1 Application Deployment Guide</i></a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Preserve Sessions</dt>
<dd><p>If the Preserve Sessions checkbox is selected, active web sessions and stateful session bean instances of the application that you are redeploying are preserved and then restored when the redeployment is complete. Persistently created EJB timers are also preserved. This option is not supported and ignored in a clustered environment.</p>

<p>Some changes to an application between redeployments prevent this feature from working properly. For example, do not change the set of instance variables in the SFSB bean class.</p>

<p>For web applications, this feature is applicable only if in the <tt>glassfish-web-app.xml</tt> file the <tt>persistence-type</tt> attribute of the <tt>session-manager</tt> element is <tt>file</tt>.</p>

<p>For stateful session bean instances, the persistence type without high availability is set in the server (the SFSB Persistence Type option under EJB Container Availability) and must be set to <tt>file</tt>, which is the default and recommended value.</p>

<p>If any active web session, SFSB instance, or EJB timer of the application fails to be preserved or restored, <b>none</b> of these will be available when the redeployment is complete. However, the redeployment continues and a warning is logged.</p>

<p>To preserve active state data, the GlassFish Server serializes the data and saves it in memory. To restore the data, the class loader of the newly redeployed application deserializes any data that was previously saved.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Precompile JSPs</dt>
<dd><p>If this option is selected, JavaServer Pages (JSP) files are precompiled. If this option is disabled, JSP files are compiled at runtime when they are first accessed. This option is disabled by default.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Run Verifier</dt>
<dd><p>If this option is selected, the verifier is run before deployment. If verification fails, deployment is not performed. The verifier examines the structure and content of the file. Verification of large applications is often time-consuming. This option is disabled by default.</p>
