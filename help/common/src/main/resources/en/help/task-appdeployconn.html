<li><b>In the navigation tree, select the Applications node.</b><p>The Applications page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Deployed Applications table, click the Deploy button.</b><p>The Deploy Applications or Modules page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>Specify the location of the application to deploy.</b><ul>
<li><b>If the application is an archive file that resides on or is accessible
from the client machine, select the option Packaged File to Be Uploaded to
the Server.</b><p>The client machine is the host on which you are viewing the Administration
Console through a browser.</p><p>Click Browse to browse to the file, or type the full path
to the file.</p></li>
<li><b>If the application is an archive file that resides on the server machine,
or is an unpackaged application from an exploded directory, select the option Local
Packaged File or Directory That Is Accessible From the GlassFish Server.</b><p>The server machine is the host that is running the domain administration server
(DAS). </p><p>Click Browse Files to browse to a file, or Browse Folders to browse
to a directory. Alternatively, type the full path name to the file or
directory. Deploying from an exploded directory is for advanced developers and is not
recommended for production environments.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><b>From the Type drop-down list, select Connector Module.</b><p>If you specified either a Packaged File to Be Uploaded to the Server
or a Local Packaged File That Is Accessible From the GlassFish Server, the
application type is detected automatically. If you specified a Directory That Is Accessible
From the GlassFish Server, you must specify the type manually.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Application Name field, retain the default name, which is the directory
name or the prefix of the file name, or type another name. </b><p>The default name appears if you chose to upload a file. The application
name must be unique.</p><p>The name can include an optional version identifier, which follows the name and is
separated from the name by a colon (<tt>:</tt>). The version identifier must begin
with a letter or number. It can contain alphanumeric characters plus underscore (<tt>_</tt>), dash
(<tt>-</tt>), and period (<tt>.</tt>) characters. For more information about module and application versions,
see the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E18930_01/html/821-2417">Module and Application Versions in <i>Oracle GlassFish Server 3.1 Application Deployment Guide</i></a>.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Status Enabled checkbox to enable the application.</b><p>This option is selected by default. If this option is disabled, the application
is unavailable.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Run Verifier checkbox to verify deployment descriptors before deployment.</b><p>If this option is selected and if verification fails, deployment is not performed.
The verifier examines the structure and content of the deployment descriptors. Verification of large
applications is often time-consuming. This option is disabled by default.</p><p>Verifier packages must be installed from the Update Tool or a warning is
logged and this option is ignored.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Force Redeploy checkbox to force redeployment if the application is already
deployed.</b><p>If this option is not selected, an attempt to deploy an application that
is already deployed results in an error. This option is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Description field, type a description for this application.</b></li>
<li><b>To add target server instances and clusters on which to deploy the module or
application, select them from the Available Targets list and use the Add button
to move them to the Selected Targets list.</b><p>The Target option appears if clusters or stand-alone server instances aside from the default
server instance (<tt>server</tt>) exist. By default, the module or application is deployed to
the default server instance, named <tt>server</tt>. Use the Add All button to deploy to
all targets. Use the Remove and Remove All buttons to remove targets from
the Selected Targets list.</p></li>
