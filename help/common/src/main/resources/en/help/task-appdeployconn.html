<li><b>In the navigation tree, select the Applications node.</b><p>The Applications page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Deployed Applications table, click the Deploy button.</b><p>The Deploy Applications or Modules page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>Specify the location of the archive that contains the application to deploy.</b><ul>
<li><b>If the archive is a file that resides on or is accessible
from the client machine, select the option Packaged File to Be Uploaded to
the Server.</b><p>The client machine is the host on which you are viewing the Administration
Console through a browser.</p><p>Click Browse to browse to the file, or type the full path
to the file.</p></li>
<li><b>If the archive is a file that resides on the server machine,
or is an unpackaged application from an exploded directory, select the option Local Packaged
File or Directory That Is Accessible From the Enterprise Server.</b><p>The server machine is the host that is running the domain administration server
(DAS). </p><p>Click Browse Files to browse to a file, or Browse Folders to
browse to a directory. Alternatively, type the full path name to the file
or directory. Deploying from an exploded directory is for advanced developers and is
not recommended for production environments.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><b>From the Type drop-down list, select Connector Module.</b><p>If you specified either a Packaged File to Be Uploaded to the Server
or a Local Packaged File That Is Accessible From the Enterprise Server, the
application type is detected automatically. If you specified a Directory That Is Accessible From
the Enterprise Server, you must specify the type manually.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Application Name field, retain the default name, which is the directory
name or the prefix of the file name, or type another name.
</b><p>The default name appears if you chose to upload a file. The
application name must be unique.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Status Enabled checkbox to enable the application.</b><p>This option is selected by default. If this option is disabled, the application
is unavailable.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Run Verifier checkbox to run the verifier before deployment.</b><p>If this option is selected and if verification fails, deployment is not performed.
The verifier examines the structure and content of the file. Verification of large
applications is often time-consuming. This option is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Force Redeploy checkbox to force redeployment if the application is already
deployed.</b><p>If this option is not selected, an attempt to deploy an application that
is already deployed results in an error. This option is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Thread Pool Id field, type the name of a thread
pool to be used by the application.</b></li>
<li><b>In the Description field, type a description for this application.</b></li>
<li><b>Click OK.</b></li></ol><h6>See Also</h6>
