<p>If the application type is Ruby Application, the following options appear.</p><dl><dt>Application Name</dt>
<dd><p>The name of the application.</p></dd>
<dt>Context Root</dt>
<dd><p>The path to the application. In the URL of the web application, the context root immediately follows the port number (<tt>http://<i>host</i>:<i>port</i>/<i>context-root</i>/...</tt>). The context root must start with a forward slash, for example, <tt>/hello</tt>.</p></dd>
<dt>Status</dt>
<dd><p>If this option is selected, the application is enabled. This option is selected by default.</p></dd>
<dt>Force Redeploy</dt>
<dd><p>If this option is selected, the application is redeployed if it is already deployed. If this option is not selected, an attempt to deploy an application that is already deployed results in an error. This option is disabled by default.</p></dd>
<dt>JRuby Home</dt>
<dd><p>The path to the directory where the JRuby container is installed. The default location is <tt></tt><i>as-install</i><tt>/jruby</tt>. If you specify a value for this field, the application value overrides the JRuby Home value set for the Ruby container.</p></dd>
<dt>Initial Pool Size</dt>
<dd><p>The initial number of JRuby runtimes to start. The value must be greater than or equal to the value in the Minimum Pool Size field and less than or equal to the value in the Maximum Pool Size field. The default value is 1. If you specify a value for this field, the application value overrides the Initial Pool Size value set for the Ruby container.</p></dd>
<dt>Minimum Pool Size</dt>
<dd><p>The minimum number of JRuby runtimes in the pool. The value must be less than or equal to the value in the Initial Pool Size field and less than or equal to the value in the Maximum Pool Size field. The default value is 1. If you specify a value for this field, the application value overrides the Minimum Pool Size value set for the Ruby container.</p></dd>
<dt>Maximum Pool Size</dt>
<dd><p>The maximum number of JRuby runtimes in the pool. The value must be greater than or equal to the value in the Minimum Pool Size field and greater than or equal to the value in the Initial Pool Size field. The default value is 1. If you specify a value for this field, the application value overrides the Maximum Pool Size value set for the Ruby container.</p></dd>
<dt>Framework</dt>
<dd><p>The framework on which the application is to be deployed. Available choices are <tt>rails</tt>, <tt>merb</tt>, <tt>sinatra</tt>, and <tt>auto-detection</tt>. The default is <tt>rails</tt>. Setting this property to a value other than <tt>auto-detection</tt> bypasses the normal, and potentially lengthy, auto-detection process and forces deployment on the specified framework. If the deployed application is not written for the specified framework, errors result.</p></dd>
<dt>Rack Environment</dt>
<dd><p>The environment in which the JRuby framework, such as Rails or Merb, runs. Available choices are <tt>production</tt>, <tt>development</tt>, and <tt>test</tt>. The default is <tt>development</tt>.</p></dd>
<dt>MT-Safe</dt>
<dd><p>The thread-safe setting for the framework in which the application will run. This property affects applications started using an auto-detected user-provided startup script. Available choices are:</p><dl><dt><tt>true</tt></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies that the framework is thread-safe and therefore does not need a pool created for it.</p></dd>
<dt><tt>false</tt></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies that the application starts with a pool of application instances, and each instance of the application is accessed by one thread at a time.</p></dd>
<dt><tt>default</tt></dt>
<dd><p>The Enterprise Server tries to detect thread safety automatically. This value is the default.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>This property only affects frameworks being launched where the thread safety cannot be automatically determined. Setting this value to <tt>true</tt> does not cause an auto-detected Rails 2.1.<i>x</i> application to be launched in thread-safe mode, nor can it be used to force a thread-safe framework to start in pooled mode.</p></dd>
<dt>Virtual Servers</dt>
<dd><p>The virtual servers associated with this application.</p></dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>A description of the application.</p></dd>
