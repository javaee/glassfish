<li><b>In the navigation tree, select the Applications node.</b><p>The Applications page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Deployed Applications table, click the Deploy button.</b><p>The Deploy Applications or Modules page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>Specify the location of the application to deploy.</b><ul>
<li><b>If the application is an archive file that resides on or is
accessible from the client machine, select the option Packaged File to Be Uploaded
to the Server.</b><p>The client machine is the host on which you are viewing the Administration
Console through a browser.</p><p>Click Browse to browse to the file, or type the full path
to the file.</p></li>
<li><b>If the application is an archive file that resides on the server machine,
or is an unpackaged application from an exploded directory, select the option Local
Packaged File or Directory That Is Accessible From the Enterprise Server.</b><p>The server machine is the host that is running the domain administration server
(DAS). </p><p>Click Browse Files to browse to a file, or Browse Folders to
browse to a directory. Alternatively, type the full path name to the file
or directory. Deploying from an exploded directory is for advanced developers and is
not recommended for production environments.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><b>From the Type drop-down list, select Enterprise Application.</b><p>If you specified either a Packaged File to Be Uploaded to the
Server or a Local Packaged File That Is Accessible From the Enterprise Server,
the application type is detected automatically. If you specified a Directory That Is
Accessible From the Enterprise Server, you must specify the type manually.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Application Name field, retain the default name, which is the directory
name or the prefix of the file name, or type another name.
</b><p>The default name appears if you chose to upload a file. The
application name must be unique.</p></li>
<li><b>From the Virtual Servers drop-down list, select the virtual server to be associated
with this application.</b></li>
<li><b>Select the Status Enabled checkbox to enable the application.</b><p>This option is selected by default. If this option is disabled, the application
is unavailable.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Precompile JSPs checkbox to precompile JavaServer Pages (JSP) files.</b><p>If this option is disabled, JSP files are compiled at runtime when they
are first accessed. This option is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Run Verifier checkbox to run the verifier before deployment.</b><p>If this option is selected and if verification fails, deployment is not performed.
The verifier examines the structure and content of the file. Verification of large
applications is often time-consuming. This option is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Java Web Start checkbox to enable Java Web Start access for
an application client.</b><p>This option is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Force Redeploy checkbox to force redeployment if the application is already
deployed.</b><p>If this option is not selected, an attempt to deploy an application that
is already deployed results in an error. This option is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Libraries field, type a comma-separated list of library JAR files specific
to this application.</b><p>The paths may be absolute or relative. A relative path is relative to
<tt></tt><i>domain-dir</i><tt>/lib/applibs</tt>. If the path is absolute, the path must be accessible to the
domain administration server (DAS), which means it must be under <tt></tt><i>domain-dir</i><tt></tt>. The libraries are
made available to the application in the order in which they are specified.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Description field, type a description for this application.</b></li>
