<a name="task-appredeploy"></a><h4>To Redeploy a Deployed Application</h4><a name="indexterm-59"></a><a name="indexterm-60"></a><p>Redeploying an application deploys a new version of the application while preserving the
settings and other options with which the application was originally deployed.</p>

<h6>Before You Begin</h6><p>Ensure that the application that you are redeploying is already deployed.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>In the navigation tree, select the Applications node.</b><p>The Applications page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Deployed Applications table, click Redeploy in the row for the application
that you are redeploying.</b><p>The Redeploy Applications or Modules page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>Specify the location of the application to redeploy.</b><ul>
<li><b>If the application is an archive file that resides on or is
accessible from the client machine, select the option Packaged File to Be Uploaded
to the Server.</b><p>The client machine is the host on which you are viewing the Administration
Console through a browser.</p><p>Click Browse to browse to the file, or type the full path
to the file.</p></li>
<li><b>If the application is an archive file that resides on the server machine,
or is an unpackaged application from an exploded directory, select the option Local
Packaged File or Directory That Is Accessible From the GlassFish Server.</b><p>The server machine is the host that is running the domain administration server
(DAS). </p><p>Click Browse Files to browse to a file, or Browse Folders to
browse to a directory. Alternatively, type the full path name to the file
or directory. Deploying from an exploded directory is for advanced developers and is
not recommended for production environments.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><b>If you require active sessions of the application to be preserved and then
restored when the redeployment is complete, select the Preserve Sessions checkbox.</b><p>If any active session of the application fails to be preserved or restored,
<b>none</b> of the sessions will be available when the redeployment is complete. However,
the redeployment continues and a warning is logged.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Precompile JSPs checkbox to precompile JavaServer Pages (JSP) files.</b><p>If this option is disabled, JSP files are compiled at runtime when they
are first accessed. This option is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Run Verifier checkbox to run the verifier before redeployment.</b><p>If this option is selected and if verification fails, redeployment is not performed.
The verifier examines the structure and content of the file. Verification of large
applications is often time-consuming. This option is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><b>Click OK.</b></li></ol><h6>See Also</h6>
