<a name="ref-managefilerealm"></a><h4>File Users</h4>
<a name="indexterm-194"></a><p>Manage <tt>file</tt> realm users with the Administration Console. Users and groups in the
<tt>file</tt> realm are listed in the key file, whose location is specified by
the <tt>file</tt> property.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>It is also possible to use these steps to add users to
any file realm, including the <tt>admin-realm</tt>. Simply substitute the name of the target realm
in place of the <tt>file</tt> realm referenced in this section.</p>
<hr>
<p>A user in the <tt>file</tt> realm can belong to a <b>Java group</b>, a
category of users classified by common traits. For example, customers of an e-commerce
application might belong to the <tt>CUSTOMER</tt> group, but the big spenders would belong
to the <tt>PREFERRED</tt> group. Categorizing users into groups makes it easier to control
the access of large numbers of users.</p><p>Initially after installation of the Enterprise Server, the only user is the administrator
entered during installation. By default, this user belongs to the group <tt>asadmin</tt>, in
the realm <tt>admin-realm</tt>, which gives rights to modify the Enterprise Server. Any users
assigned to this group will have administrator privileges, that is, they will have
access to the <tt>asadmin</tt> tool and the Administration Console.</p><p>The File Users page displays a list of users for the selected
realm. For each user, the following information is provided:</p><dl><dt>User ID</dt>
<dd><p>The user name.</p></dd>
<dt>Group List</dt>
<dd><p>The groups to which the user belongs.</p></dd>
