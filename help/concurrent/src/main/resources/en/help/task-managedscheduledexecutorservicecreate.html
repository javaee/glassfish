<p>By default, the resource is enabled, meaning that it is available as soon as it is created.</p>
</li>

<p>GlassFish Server does not define any additional properties for managed scheduled executor service resources.</p>
<p>To add a property, click the Add Property button. In the blank row that appears, type the property name in the Name field, and type the property value in the Value field.</p>
