<a name="ref-jmsconnectionnew"></a><h4>New JMS Connection Factory</h4>
<a name="indexterm-29"></a><a name="indexterm-30"></a><p>Use the New JMS Connection Factory page to create a new JMS
connection factory.</p><p>The New JMS Connection Factory page contains the following options.</p><dl><dt>JNDI Name</dt>
<dd><p>A unique name that identifies the connection factory. It is a recommended practice to use the naming subcontext prefix <tt>jms/</tt> for JMS resources. For example: <tt>jms/ConnectionFactory1</tt>.</p></dd>
<dt>Resource Type</dt>
<dd><p>The type of the connection factory. Available choices are <tt>javax.jms.ConnectionFactory</tt>, <tt>javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory</tt>, and <tt>javax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory</tt>.</p></dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>A description of the connection factory.</p></dd>
<dt>Status</dt>
<dd><p>The status of the connection factory. The connection factory can be enabled or disabled. This option is enabled by default.</p></dd>
<dt>Initial and Minimum Pool Size</dt>
<dd><p>The minimum number of connections in the pool for the connection factory. The default value is 8.</p></dd>
<dt>Maximum Pool Size</dt>
<dd><p>The maximum number of connections in the pool for the connection factory. The default value is 32.</p></dd>
<dt>Pool Resize Quantity</dt>
<dd><p>The number of connections to be removed when pool idle timeout expires. The default value is 2.</p></dd>
<dt>Idle Timeout</dt>
<dd><p>The maximum time in seconds that a connection can remain idle in the pool. The default value is 300.</p></dd>
<dt>Max Wait Time</dt>
<dd><p>The amount of time the application requesting a connection will wait before getting a connection timeout. The default value is 60000.</p></dd>
<dt>On Any Failure</dt>
<dd><p>If the Close All Connections checkbox is selected, the Enterprise Server will close all connections in the pool and reestablish them if a single connection fails. This option is disabled by default.</p></dd>
<dt>Transaction Support</dt>
<dd><p>The chosen transaction support overrides the transaction support attribute in the resource adapter associated with this connection pool in a downward compatible way. In other words, it can support a lower transaction level than that specified in the resource adapter, or the same transaction level as that specified in resource adapter, but it cannot specify a higher level.</p><p>The value may be any of the following:</p><dl><dt>XATransaction</dt>
<dd><p>The resource can be used for transactions that involve the use of more than one resource within a transaction scope. This value is the default for a JMS connection factory. </p><p>For example, transactions may involve this resource plus a JDBC resource, a connector resource, or another JMS connection factory resource. This value offers the most flexibility. A resource that is configured as XATransaction will participate in two-phase commit operations.</p></dd>
<dt>LocalTransaction</dt>
<dd><p>The resource can be used either for transactions that involve only one resource within the transaction scope or as the last agent in a distributed transaction that involves more than one XA resource.</p><p>This value offers significantly better performance. A resource that is configured as LocalTransaction will not be used in two-phase commit operations.</p></dd>
<dt>NoTransaction</dt>
<dd><p>The resource can never participate in transactions. This setting is of limited use in JMS applications.</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Connection Validation</dt>
<dd><p>If the Required checkbox is selected, connections are validated before being given to the application. If a resource's validation fails, it is destroyed, and a new resource is created and returned. This option is disabled by default.</p></dd>
<dt>Additional Properties</dt>
<dd><p>Additional properties for the connection factory.</p><p>For information on available properties, see <a href="ref-jmsconnectionproperties.html">Properties Specific to JMS Connection Factories</a>.</p></dd>
