monitoring, cluster membership, and group communication services. The GMS performs the following functions:</p>


<ul><li><p>Notifies registered modules in a GlassFish Server instance when one or more member instances are added to or removed from a cluster, or are suspected or confirmed to have failed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Provides the ability to send and receive messages between a group of processes.</p>

</li></ul>
<ol>
<li><b>In the navigation tree, expand the Clusters node.</b></li>
<li><b>Select the cluster for which you are enabling the Group Management Service
(GMS).</b><p>The General Information page for the cluster opens.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the GMS Enabled checkbox to enable the GMS for the cluster.</b><p>This option is selected by default. To disable the GMS for the cluster,
remove the check from the GMS Enabled checkbox.</p><p>If enabled, the Group Management Service is started in each server instance
in the cluster and in the Domain Administration Server (DAS). The DAS
participates in each cluster that has GMS enabled.</p></li>
