<a name="task-gmscluster"></a><h4>To Configure Group Management Service Settings for a Cluster</h4><a name="indexterm-152"></a><p>The Group Management Service (GMS) is an in-process service that provides cluster
monitoring, cluster membership, and group communication services. The GMS performs the following functions:</p>


<ul><li><p>Notifies registered modules in a GlassFish Server instance when one or more member instances are added to or removed from a cluster, or are suspected or confirmed to have failed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Provides the ability to send and receive messages between a group of processes.</p>

</li></ul>
<ol>
<li><b>In the navigation tree, expand the Clusters node.</b></li>
<li><b>Select the cluster for which you are configuring Group Management Service (GMS)
settings.</b><p>The General Information page for the cluster opens.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the GMS Enabled checkbox to enable the GMS for the cluster.</b><p>This option is selected by default. To disable the GMS for the cluster,
remove the check from the GMS Enabled checkbox.</p><p>If enabled, the Group Management Service is started in each server instance
in the cluster and in the Domain Administration Server (DAS). The DAS
participates in each cluster that has GMS enabled.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Multicast Port field, enter the port the Group Management Service
uses to listen for group events.</b><p>Specify a standard UDP port number in the range 2048&#8211;32000. The default is
an automatically generated value in this range.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Multicast Address field, enter the address the Group Management Service
uses to listen for group events.</b><p>Specify a class D IP multicast address. Class D IP addresses are in
the range <tt>224.0.0.0</tt> to <tt>239.255.255.255</tt>, inclusive. The address <tt>224.0.0.0</tt> is reserved and
should not be used. The default is 228.9.<i>XX</i>.<i>YY</i>, where <i>XX</i> and <i>YY</i>
are automatically generated independent values between 0 and 255.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Bind Interface Address field, enter the network interface address for
the Group Management Service if there is more than one network interface.</b><p>This setting enables you to configure which network interface is used for
the GMS if there is more than one on any of the
machines hosting the server instances in the cluster. This value must be a
local network interface IP address. By default all public network interface addresses
are used.</p><p>To specify an address that is valid for all GlassFish Server instances
in the cluster, use a system property to set the address individually
for each instance.</p><p>For example, create the system property <tt>GMS-BIND-INTERFACE-ADDRESS-<i>cluster-name</i></tt> on the DAS. Then set
this Bind Interface Address option to <tt>${GMS-BIND-INTERFACE-ADDRESS-<i>cluster-name</i>}</tt> to specify the system property. Finally, for
each instance in the cluster, set the <tt>GMS-BIND-INTERFACE-ADDRESS-<i>cluster-name</i></tt> system property to the required
network interface address on the instance's machine.</p></li>
<li>(Optional) <b>To specify additional properties, select the Properties tab and the Cluster Properties
sub-tab.</b><p>GlassFish Server does not define any additional properties for the GMS.</p><ul>
<li><b>To add a property, click the Add Property button. In the blank
row that appears, type the property name in the Name field, and
type the property value in the Value field.</b></li>
<li><b>To modify a property, edit that property's Value field.</b></li>
<li><b>To delete a property, select the checkbox to the left of the
Name field of the property that you are deleting, then click the
Delete Properties button.</b></li></ul></li>
<li><b>Click Save.</b></li></ol><h6>See Also</h6>
