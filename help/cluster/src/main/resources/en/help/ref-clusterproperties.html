<a name="ref-clusterproperties"></a><h4>Cluster Properties</h4>
<a name="indexterm-183"></a><a name="indexterm-184"></a><p>The Cluster Properties page displays a list of the properties that are set
for the selected clusters. These properties add optional configuration information about the cluster.</p>

<p>The Cluster Name field is a read-only field that displays the name of
the selected cluster.</p>

<p>For each property, the following information is displayed:</p>

<dl><dt>Name</dt>
<dd><p>The name of the property.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Value</dt>
<dd><p>The value that of the property that is set for the selected instance.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p>A textual description that provides more information about the property.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Additional Properties table also contains the following options.</p>

<dl><dt>Add Property</dt>
<dd><p>Button to add a property. Clicking this button adds a row to the Additional Properties table.</p>

</dd>
<dt>Delete Properties</dt>
<dd><p>Button to delete one or more selected properties. Any property that is deleted reverts to its default value or, if no default value is set, is undefined.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>GlassFish Server defines the following cluster properties:</p>

<dl><dt><tt>GMS_LISTENER_PORT</tt></dt>
<dd><p>The port number of the port on which the cluster listens for messages from the Group Management Service (GMS). The default value should suffice in most situations.</p>

</dd>
<dt><tt>GMS_LOOPBACK</tt></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies whether an instance may receive from itself application-level messages that the instance broadcasts to the cluster.</p>

<p>Possible values are as follows:</p>

<dl><dt><tt>false</tt></dt>
<dd><p>The instance may <b>not</b> receive messages from itself (default).</p>

</dd>
<dt><tt>true</tt></dt>
<dd><p>The instance may receive messages from itself. Use this setting for testing an instance when the instance is the only instance in a cluster.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><tt>GMS_MULTICAST_TIME_TO_LIVE</tt></dt>
<dd><p>The maximum number of iterations or transmissions that a multicast message for the following types of events can experience before the message is discarded:</p>


<ul><li><p>Group discovery</p>

</li>
<li><p>Member heartbeats</p>

</li>
<li><p>Membership changes</p>

</li></ul>
<p>To match the configuration of the network on which the DAS and clustered instances are deployed, set this value as low as possible. To determine the lowest possible value for your system, use the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E18930_01/html/821-2433"><tt>validate-multicast</tt>(1)</a> subcommand.</p>

<p>A value of 0 ensures that multicast messages never leave the host from which they are broadcast.</p>

<p>A value of 1 might prevent the broadcast of messages between hosts on same subnet that are connected by a switch or a router. </p>

<p>The default is 4, which ensures that messages are successfully broadcast to all cluster members in networks where hosts are connected by switches or routers.</p>
