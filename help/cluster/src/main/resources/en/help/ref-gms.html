<p>The Group Management Service (GMS) is an in-process service that provides cluster monitoring,
cluster membership, and group communication services. The GMS is built atop a configurable
stack of group membership discovery and health monitoring protocols. The GMS performs the
following functions:</p>


<ul><li><p>Notifies registered modules in a GlassFish Server instance when one or more member instances are added to or removed from a cluster, or are suspected or confirmed to have failed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Provides the ability to send and receive messages between a group of processes.</p>

</li></ul>
<p>The Group Management Service page contains the following options.</p>

<dl><dt>Load Defaults</dt>
<dd><p>Button to restore the default values of all the settings.</p>
