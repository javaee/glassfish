<li><b>In the navigation tree, select the Configuration node.</b></li>
<li><b>Select the EJB Container node.</b><p>The Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) page opens.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Session Store Location field, type a new value for the session
store location.</b><p>This field specifies the directory where passivated stateful session beans and persisted HTTP
sessions are stored on the file system. The default value is <tt>${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/session-store</tt>.</p><p>Passivated beans are stateful session beans that have had their state written to
a file on the file system. Passivated beans typically have been idle for
a certain period of time, and are not currently being accessed by clients.
Similarly, persisted HTTP sessions are individual web sessions that have had their state
written to a file on the file system.</p></li>
<li><b>Select the Option B or Option C radio button to set the
Commit Option.</b><p>The Commit Option specifies how the container caches passivated bean instances between transactions.</p><ul>
<li><b>If you select Option B (the default), the container caches a ready instance
between transactions.</b></li>
<li><b>If you select Option C, the container does not cache a ready
instance between transactions.</b></li></ul></li>
<li><b>In the Initial and Minimum Pool Size field, type the minimum number of
beans to be maintained in the pool.</b><p>The default value is 0.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Maximum Pool Size field, type the maximum number of beans that
the container can maintain in the pool at one time.</b><p>The default value is 32.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Pool Resize Quantity field, type the number of beans that will
be removed from the pool if they are idle for more than
the time specified in the Pool Idle Timeout field.</b><p>The value must be at least 0 and less than the Maximum Pool
Size value. The default value is 8.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Pool Idle Timeout field, type the time, in seconds, that a
bean in the pool can remain idle before it will be removed
from the pool.</b><p>After this amount of time, the bean is destroyed. A value of
0 means that a bean can remain idle indefinitely. The default value is
600.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Max Cache Size field, type the maximum number of beans to
be held in the cache.</b><p>Increase the maximum number of beans to cache to eliminate the overhead of
bean creation and destruction. However, if the cache is increased, the server consumes
more memory and resources. Be sure your operating environment is sufficient for your
cache settings. A value of 0 indicates an unbounded cache. The default value
is 512.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Cache Resize Quantity field, type the number of beans to passivate
when the cache is full.</b><p>When the maximum number of cached beans is reached, the container removes a
number of passivated beans from the backup store. This value also specifies the
number of beans to be created if a request arrives when the pool
has no available beans. The value must be greater than 1 and less
than the Max Cache Size value. The default value is 32.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Removal Timeout field, type the number of seconds after which a
passivated bean is removed from the session store.</b><p>A value of 0 specifies that the container does not remove inactive beans
automatically. If the Removal Timeout value is less than or equal to the
Cache Idle Timeout value, beans are removed immediately without being passivated. The default value
is 5400.</p></li>
<li><b>From the Removal Selection Policy drop-down list, select the policy the container uses
to remove stateful session beans from the cache.</b><p>The choices are as follows:</p><dl><dt>Not recently used (NRU)</dt>
<dd><p>(Default) Removes a bean that hasn&#8217;t been used recently.</p></dd>
<dt>First in, first out (FIFO)</dt>
<dd><p>Removes the oldest bean in the cache.</p></dd>
<dt>Least recently used (LRU)</dt>
<dd><p>Removes the least recently accessed bean.</p></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><b>In the Cache Idle Timeout field, type the maximum number of seconds that
a bean can remain idle in the cache.</b><p>After this amount of time, the container can passivate this bean. A value
of 0 specifies that beans never become candidates for passivation. The default value
is 600.</p></li>
<li>(Optional) <b>In the Additional Properties section, specify additional properties.</b><p>The Enterprise Server does not define any additional properties for the EJB container.</p><ul>
<li><b>To add a property, click the Add Property button. In the blank row
that appears, type the property name in the Name field, and type
the property value in the Value field.</b></li>
<li><b>To modify a property, edit that property's Value field.</b></li>
<li><b>To delete a property, select the checkbox to the left of the
Name field of the property that you are deleting, then click the Delete
Properties button.</b></li></ul></li>
<li><b>Click Save.</b>
<hr><p><b>Tip - </b>To return to the default settings, click the Load Defaults button, then click
Save.</p>
