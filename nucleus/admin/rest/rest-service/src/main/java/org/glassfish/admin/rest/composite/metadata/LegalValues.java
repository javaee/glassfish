/**
 * Used to indicate that a String model property can only contain a specific list of strings.
 *
 * Typically a model property will use a java enum instead.  However, there are some cases
 * where a String property is defined in a base model (e.g. a Job's status property) and the
 * various derived models specify what values they allow for the that inherited property
 * (e.g. a ServerJob's status property).
 * In these cases, the model property needs to use a String instead of a java enum (since
 * the base model doesn't know what the possible values are), and this annotation is added
 * in the derived models to the inherited property to restrict what values it can hold.
