/**
 * Annotation that qualifies a configuration element that can only exist
 * as a singleton in the configuration tree.
 *
 * When configuration elements are added to their parents through a
 * subclassing pattern, it can be difficult for the system to determine if this
 * element can exist as a singleton or a collection.
 *
 * For instance, when the parent contains :
 * <code>
 * @Element("*")
 * List<Extension> getExtensions();
 * </code>
 *
 * A subclass of Extension can have a single or multiple instances stored
 * in the extensions list. Adding this annotation will qualify that only
 * one instance of the annotated configuration can be found in that
 * collection. Note that the collection can contain other instances of other
 * subclasses of Extension.
