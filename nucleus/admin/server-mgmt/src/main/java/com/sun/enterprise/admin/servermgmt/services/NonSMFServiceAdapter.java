/**
 * The original implementation of Services had serious design problems.  The Service interface
 * is ENORMOUSLY fat and non OO in the sense that outside callers had to set things
 * to make things work.  The interface is not generic -- it is very SMF specific
 * It is extremely difficult to implement the interface because it has SO MANY methods
 * that non-SMF don't need.
 * This "Adapter" makes it easier to implement the interface.  Eventually we should
 * have one adapter for all services but the SMF code is difficult and time-consuming
 * to change.
 * Meantime I'm adding new functionality (August 2010, bnevins) for instances.  I'm
 * moving implementations of the new interface methods to "ServiceAdapter" which ALL
 * services extend.
