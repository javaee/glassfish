 * GF --> FlashlightProbeProviderFactory.java
 * Apparently it is used exclusively for making sure that 2 probes with the same name are not allowed?!?
 * look at the putIfAbsent for clues
 * This class has no business having any public members and should be moved to the only user's package
 *
 * I'm suspicious.  Maybe it is called by reflection from somewhere?!?
