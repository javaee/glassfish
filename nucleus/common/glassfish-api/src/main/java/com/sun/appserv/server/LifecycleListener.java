/**
 * lifecycle modules implement <code>com.sun.appserv.server.LifecycleListener</code> interface. 
 * There is just one method in this interface: <code>handleEvent()</code> which posts server
 * lifecycle events to the lifecycle modules.
 * <p>
 * Upon start up, before initializing its subsystems application server posts lifcycle modules the 
 * <code>INIT_EVENT</code>. This is followed by server posting the <code>STARTUP_EVENT</code> to the 
 * lifecycle modules upon which server starts loading and initializaing the applications. Once this 
 * phase is completed, the <code>READY_EVENT</code> is posted to the lifecycle modules.
 * <p>
 * When the server is shutdown, server posts the <code>SHUTDOWN_EVENT</code> to the lifecycle modules and
 * then shuts down the applications and subsystems. Once this phase is completed the 
 * <code>TERMINATION_EVENT</code> is posted.
 * <p>
 * Note that lifecycle modules may obtain the event specific data by calling <code>getData()</code> 
 * on the event parameter in the <code>handleEvent()</code>. For the INIT_EVENT event,
 * <code>getData()</code> returns the lifecycle module's properties configured in server.xml.
 * <p>
 *  When <code>is-failure-fatal</code> in server.xml is set to <code>true</code>, all exceptions from the
 *  lifecycle modules are treated as fatal conditions.
