/**
 * Interface for admin command payloads--data carried
 * in the http request and response which flow between the admin client and the server.
 * This API also allows the requester to ask that the receiver remove a file,
 * presumably one that was transferred via an earlier request payload.
 * <h2>Motivation and Overview</h2>
 * The API is intended to be a simple abstraction of the
 * input and output streams in HTTP requests and responses,
 * inspired by the concepts from the mail API for
 * MIME body parts and multiparts.
 * A payload can contain zero or more parts.
 * If a payload contains only one part then only that part is sent or received
 * in the payload.  If, on the other hand, the payload contains multiple parts
 * then the payload as a whole is a "multipart" payload which in turn contains
 * the individual parts.
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <h3>Outbound</h3>
 * Code (on the client or the server) that needs to place data in the payload or
 * request that earlier-sent data be removed
 * would instantiate an implementation of {@link Payload.Outbound}. (The
 * {@link org.glassfish.admin.payload.PayloadImpl.Outbound} class is such an implementation.)
 * To this Payload.Outbound object the code can add parts using any of the {@link Outbound#addPart}
 * methods or the {@link Outbound#attachFile} or {@link Outbound#requestFileRemoval} convenience methods.
 * After the code has added all
 * the relevant parts to the payload it invokes the {@link Outbound#writeTo} method to write
 * the outbound payload to an OutputStream.  Typically the caller will pass the
 * output stream associated with the request (in the client case) or the response (in the
 * server case).
 * <h3>Inbound</h3>
 * Code that needs to read the payload from a request (as the server does) or
 * from a response (as the client does) will instantiate an implementation of
 * {@link Payload.Inbound}. (The {@link org.glassfish.admin.payload.PayloadImpl.Inbound}
 * is such an implementation.
 * <p>
 * Payload.Inbound exposes the {@link Payload.Inbound#parts()} method
 * which returns an Iterator&lt;Part&gt;.  With each {@link Part} available through the
 * iterator the caller can use {@link Part#getContentType()},
 * {@link Part#getName()}, and {@link Part#getInputStream()}.
 * Note that the caller should close the InputStream returned by getInputStream()
 * once it has read the data from the stream.
 * <h2>Part Properties</h2>
 * Each Part can carry with it Properties.  The conventions as to what property
 * names are used and what they mean can vary from one admin command to the next.
 * For a file transfer these properties should be set:
 * <ul>
 * <li>data-request-type=file-xfer
 * <li>data-request-name=(anything - typically the option name from the command to
 * help identify which part goes with which command argument)
 * <li>file-xfer-root=root path expression in the file system syntax of the system
 * where tranferred files will reside.
 * <li>last-modified=String representation of the long value recording the last-modified time of the original file
 * </ul>
 * As an example as the server processes the "--retrieve xxx" option on the deploy and redeploy commands
 * it will specify file-xfer-root as xxx (in this example) to indicate where the
 * downloaded app client files should be stored on the
 * local system.  Placing such information in the Part's properties helps to
 * decouple the admin client from the specifics of the command which triggered
 * the file transfer.  That is, for example, the admin client does not need to
 * fetch the "--retrieve" option value to know where to store the transferred files
 * because the server placed this information with each part.  The admin client
 * can therefore process this type of admin data request generically, without
 * regard to what command triggered the transfer.
 * <p>
 * The receiver of the file transfer request should return the
 * file-xfer-root value back to the requester without change so the local file path
 * syntax can be used correctly on the system where the file will exist.  
 * <h2>Notes and Restrictions</h2>
 * In some implementations the caller must consume the contents of a
 * Part's input stream before advancing to the next Part.  All callers should
 * follow this practice regardless of the underlying implementation used, in case
 * that implementation were to change in the future.
