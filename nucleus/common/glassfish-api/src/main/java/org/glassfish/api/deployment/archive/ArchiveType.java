/**
 * ArchiveType is an extension over ModuleType defined in jsr88 API.
 * It is analogous to type of an archive  or a module or deployment unit, whichever way you prefer to call them.
 * Adding a new archive type (or ArchiveType) is a very expensive operation.
 * For example, there has been no new archive types introduced in Java EE since RAR type.
 * Adding a new archive type involves writing an ArchiveHandler which involves writing logic to create class loaders.
 * Now, that's not same as adding adding a technology type like jersey or jpa.
 * <p/>
 * This is only a contract. Actual types are made available as services by appropriate containers.
 * <p/>
 * GlassFish deployment framework uses the word container to refer to services. Containers are actually defined in
 * Java EE platform spec. ArchiveType maps to the way containers are defined in the Java EE platform spec.
