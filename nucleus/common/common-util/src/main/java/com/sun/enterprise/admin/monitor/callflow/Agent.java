 *
 * Further, it is possible to set filters, based on client side	attributes
 * such	as caller IP address and caller	security principal (USER).
 *
 * The trap point call sequence	has a specific order:
 *

 *	  requestStart,	addRequestInfo*, requestInfoComplete,
 *	  (startTime, (webMethodStart|ejbMethodStart))*,
 *	  ((ejbMethodEnd|webMethodEnd),	endTime)*,
