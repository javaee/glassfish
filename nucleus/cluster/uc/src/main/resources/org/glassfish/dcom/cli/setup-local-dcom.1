asadmin Utility Subcommands                             setup-local-dcom(1)

NAME
       setup-local-dcom - sets up DCOM on a host

SYNOPSIS
           setup-local-dcom [--help] [--verbose={false|true}]
           --force={false|true}

DESCRIPTION
       The setup-local-dcom subcommand sets up the Distributed Component
       Object Model (DCOM) remote protocol on the host where the subcommand is
       run. The DCOM remote protocol is available only on Windows systems.

       This subcommand must be run by the operating-system-level administrator
       user on the host where DCOM is being set up. Before running this
       command, ensure that items in the Windows operating system are set as
       described in "Windows Operating System Settings" in Oracle GlassFish
       Server High Availability Administration Guide.

       Setting up DCOM on a host ensures that scripts can be run on the host
       from a remote host. To run scripts on the host from a remote host, the
       Windows user must be allowed full control over some Windows registry
       keys.

       In some versions of Windows, only the user NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller
       has full control over these Windows registry keys. If the version of
       Windows on a host is configured in this way, this subcommand modifies
       these keys to allow full control over them for the Windows user.

           Caution
           
           This subcommand might modify the permissions of some keys in the 
           Windows registry Before running this command, back up the Windows‚
           registry. 

       By default, the subcommand prompts you to confirm that you want to
       update the Windows registry. To run the subcommand without being
       prompted, set the --force option to true.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only.
