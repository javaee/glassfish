THis is a place-holder.  I'm not sure how to set this all up permanently.

validate-local-dcom is a command that is in the 4.0 codebase in cluster-cli

It is NOT in 3.1.2

This project makes a jar file with just the exe file and  the asadmin command class.  The source for the command class is copied 
from cluster-cli

To use with 3.1.2 -- simply drop the jar into GF/lib/asadmin
