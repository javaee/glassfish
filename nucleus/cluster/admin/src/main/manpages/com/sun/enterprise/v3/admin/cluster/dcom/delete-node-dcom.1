NAME
       delete-node-dcom - deletes a node that is enabled for communication
       over DCOM

SYNOPSIS
           delete-node-dcom [--help]
           [--uninstall={false|true}] [--force={false|true}]
           node-name

DESCRIPTION
       The delete-node-dcom subcommand deletes a node that is enabled for
       communication over the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) remote
       protocol from the domain. The DCOM protocol is available only on
       Windows systems. This subcommand does not require DCOM to be
       configured.

       This subcommand can delete only a node that is enabled for
       communication over DCOM. The subcommand for deleting other types of
       nodes depends on the type of the node:

       *   A node that is enabled for communication over secure shell (SSH)
           must be deleted by using the delete-node-ssh(1) subcommand.

       *   A node that is not enabled for communication must be deleted by
           using the delete-node-config(1) subcommand.

       To determine whether a node is enabled for communication over DCOM, use
       the list-nodes(1) subcommand.

       No GlassFish Server instances must reside on the node that is being
       deleted. Otherwise, the subcommand fails. Before running this
       subcommand, delete any instances that reside on the node by using, for
       example, the delete-instance(1) subcommand or the
       delete-local-instance(1) subcommand.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --uninstall
           Specifies whether the GlassFish Server software is uninstalled from
           host that the node represents.

           Possible values are as follows:

           false
               The GlassFish Server software is not uninstalled from the host
               (default).

           true
               The GlassFish Server software is uninstalled from the host. By
               default, if any node except the predefined node
               localhost-domain resides on any host from which GlassFish
               Server software is being uninstalled, the subcommand fails. To
               uninstall the GlassFish Server software from a host on which
               user-defined nodes reside, set the --force option to true. If
               the --force option is true, the subcommand removes the entire
               content of the parent of the base installation directory.

       --force
           If --uninstall is true, specifies whether the subcommand uninstalls
           the GlassFish Server software from a host even if a user-defined
           node resides on the host. Possible values are as follows:

           false
               If a user-defined node resides on a host, the software is not
               uninstalled and the subcommand fails (default).

               If the --force option is false, the subcommand removes only the
               GlassFish Server software files. Other content if the parent of
               the base installation directory, such as configuration files,
               are not removed.

           true
               The subcommand uninstalls the GlassFish Server software from
               the host even if a user-defined node resides on the host.

               If the --force option is true, the subcommand removes the
               entire content of the parent of the base installation
               directory.

OPERANDS
       node-name
           The name of the node to delete. The node must enabled for
           communication over DCOM. Otherwise, an error occurs.
