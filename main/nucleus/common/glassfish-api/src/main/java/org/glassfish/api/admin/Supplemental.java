/**
 * Annotation to define a supplemental command
 *
 * A supplemental command runs when a main command implementation is ran, it can be
 * used to attach behaviours to existing commands without modifying the original
 * implementation.
 *
 * <p>A supplemental command can be very useful to configure extra or external components
 * of an installation. For instance, a load-balancer module can be installed
 * when a load-balancer is added to a glassfish installation. Such module can contain
 * supplemental commands to supplement commands like "create-instance" in order to update
 * the load-balancer specific information.
 *
 * <p>An implementation must use the value() attribute of the @Supplemental annotation
 * to express the supplemented command. Its value is the name of the command as defined
 * by the supplemented command @Service annotation.
 *
 * <p>Example : take a command implementation
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * &#64Service(name="randomCommand")
 * public MyRandomCommand implements AdminCommand {
 * ...
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>a supplemental command may be defined as follows :
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * &#64Service(name="mySupCommand")
 * &#64Supplemental("randomCommand")
 * public MySupplementalCommand implements AdminCommand {
 * ...
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Another implementation that does not use the same parameter names as the
 * supplemented command will need to use a @Bridge annotation
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * &#64Service(name="otherSupCommand")
 * &#64Supplemental(value="randomCommand" bridge=MyParameterMapper.class)
 * public OtherSupplementedCommand implements AdminCommand {
 * ...
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>There can be several supplemental commands for a command implementation.
 *
 * <p>A supplemental command can be executed in "isolation" (not part of the supplemented
 * command execution) and should not make any assumption that it is called as part
 * of its supplemented command execution. If a command should not be invokable in
 * isolation, it must not define a name() attribute on the @Service annotation :
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * &#64Service
 * &#64Supplemental("randomCommand")
 * public MySupplementalCommand implements AdminCommand {
 *  // can only be invoked as a supplemental command
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>If a supplemental command is annotated with @Rollback, the annotation will be ignored
 * when the supplemental command is executed in isolation.
 *
 * <p>If a supplemental command is annotated with @Rollback, it is still subject to the
 * supplemented command {@link org.glassfish.api.admin.ExecuteOn#ifFailure()} value to decide
 * whether or not roll-backing should happen in case of failure.
 *
 * <p>When associating a supplemental command to a command X, it's always a good idea
 * to associate a roll-backing supplemental command to the rollbacking command of X.
 * For instance, if an "add-lb-config" supplemental command is attached to the
 * "create-instance" command, a "delete-lb-config" supplemental command should be
 * attached to the "delete-instance" command.
