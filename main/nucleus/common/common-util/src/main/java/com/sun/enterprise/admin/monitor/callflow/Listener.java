/**
 * This interface exposes the call flow Listener API.
 * 
 * This interface is implemented by listeners that are registered with the
 * call flow agent, in order to receive the call flow trap point notifications.
 *
 * Note 1: There are no ordering guaratees for the various notifications.
 * 
 * Note 2: A listener implementation must be stateless. This is allow the
 * listener to be accessed concurrently by multiple threads, and yet avoid
 * synchronization overhead associated with protected access to shared state,
 * in a multi-threaded environment.
 *
 * Note 3: It is also imperative that the listener implementation is
 * light-weight, and avoids time consuming operations such as disk access,
 * logging, synchronization locks, et cetera. This will ensure that the
 * listener does not negatively impact the performance of the
 * application thread.
