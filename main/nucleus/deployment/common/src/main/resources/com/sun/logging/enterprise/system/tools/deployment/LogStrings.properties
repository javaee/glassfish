enterprise.deployment.backend.appClientArtifactOutOfOrder=DPL8022: Artifact {0} identified for inclusion in app clients after one or more app clients were generated.
DPL8022.diag.cause.1=The application might specify that modules are to be processed in the order they appear in the application and an app client module appears before a module that creates an artifact to be included in app clients.
DPL8022.diag.check.1=Make sure, if the application specifies initialize-in-order as true, that the app clients appear after other modules which generated artifacts that should be accessible to app clients.

enterprise.deployment.backend.appClientArtifactMissing=DPL8024: Artifact with relative path {0} expected at {1} but does not exist or cannot be read
DPL8024.diag.cause.1=The server is attempting to register an artifact to be included in the generated app client JAR but the artifact does not exist or cannot be read

DPL8026.diag.cause.1=A submodule in an EAR can have the same name as its expansion location but the submodule must be of the correct storage type (such as a directory, not a JAR) as well.
DPL8026.diag.check.1=Rename the submodule JAR in the application so it is not the same name as the expansion directory the server uses, or keep the same name but package it in the EAR as a subdirectory and not as a JAR file.

counterpart.configdd.exists=DPL8027: Ignore {0} in archive {1}, as higher precendence runtime xml {2} is present in the same archive.
invalidwlmoduletype=DPL8028: [{0}] is not an allowed WebLogic module type. Allowed module types are JMS, JDBC and Interception.
sun.configdd.deprecate=DPL8030: Sun specific deployment descriptor ({0} in archive {1}) is deprecating, please use GlassFish specific deployment descriptor {2} in the future.

enterprise.deployment.filePredatesArchive=DPL8031: Ignoring {0} because the containing archive {1} recorded it as a pre-existing stale file
DPL8031.diag.cause.1=A file inside a file archive predates the archive and is therefore being hidden and will appear not to exist in the archive
DPL8031.diag.check.1=The file might have been opened but never closed, for instance during an earlier deployment of an application, and incorrectly remains in the archive after an undeployment.

enterprise.deployment.nullFileList=DPL8032: Attempt to list files in {0} failed, perhaps because that is not a valid directory or because file permissions do not allow GlassFish to access it
DPL8032.diag.cause.1=The file should have been a directory which GlassFish could read; instead it might not be a directory or it might be a directory which GlassFish cannot access
DPL8032.diag.check.1=Make sure the file is a directory and that its file protections permit GlassFish to list the files in it

enterprise.deployment.deleteFailed=DPL8033: Attempt to delete file {0} failed; no further information.
DPL8033.diag.cause.1=The file could not be deleted and no further information about the failure is available.
DPL8033.diag.check.1=Make sure the directory containing the file allows GlassFish to delete the file and that no other processes have the file open.

enterprise.deployment.mkdirsFailed=DPL8034: Attempt to create directory {0} failed; no further information.
DPL8034.diag.cause.1=The directory {0} and/or intervening directories could not be created and no further information about the failure is available.

DPL8036.diag.check.1=Make sure the file permissions allow GlassFish to change the last modified date/time.

wls.counterpart.configdd.exists=DPL8037: Ignore {0} in archive {1}, as WLS counterpart runtime xml {2} is present in the same archive.
