/**
 *  <p>	This class is configured via XML (i.e. a console-config.xml file).
 *  	This is done via the HK2 <code>ConfigParser</code>.</p>
 *
 *  <p>	Each module that wishes to provide an integration with the GlassFish
 *	admin console should provide a <code>console-config.xml</code> file
 *	which provides all the {@link IntegrationPoint} information for the
 *	module.  Here is an example of what that file might look like:</p>
 *
 *  <p><code><pre>
 *	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 *
 *	<console-config id="uniqueId">
 *	    <integration-point id="someId" type="tree" priority="840"
 *		    parentId="rootNode" content="/myTreeNode.jsf" />
 *	    <integration-point id="anotherId" type="webApplicationTab"
 *		    priority="22" parentId="appTab" content="/myTab.jsf" />
 *	    <integration-point id="fooId" type="tree" priority="400"
 *		    parentId="appNode" content="/fooNode.jsf" />
 *	</console-config>
 *
 *  </pre></code></p>
 *
 *  <p>	Normally a <code>console-config.xml</code> file should exist at
 *	"<code>META-INF/admingui/console-config.xml</code>" inside your module
 *	jar file.</p>
