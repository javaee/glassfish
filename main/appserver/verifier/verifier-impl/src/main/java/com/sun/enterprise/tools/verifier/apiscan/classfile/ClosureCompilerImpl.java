/**
 * This is single most important class of the apiscan package. This class is
 * used to compute the complete closure of a set of classes. It uses {@link
 * ClassFile} to find out dependencies of a class. For each references class
 * name, it loads the corresponding ClassFile using the ClassFileLoader passed
 * to it in constructor. Then it recurssively computes the dependencies until it
 * visits either Java primitive classes or the class name matches the exclude
 * list. Example of using this class is given below...
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * String classpath="your own classpath";
 * ClassFileLoader cfl=ClassFileLoaderFactory.newInstance(new
 * Object[]{classpath});
 * ClosureCompilerImpl cc=new ClosureCompilerImpl(cfl);
 * cc.addExcludePattern("java.");//exclude all classes that start with java.
 * Most of the J2SE classes will be excluded thus.
  * cc.addExcludePattern("javax.");//Most of the J2EE classes can be excluded
 * like this.
 * cc.addExcludePackage("org.omg.CORBA");//Exclude classes whose package name is
 * org.omg.CORBA
 * cc.addExcludeClass("mypackage.Foo");//Exclude class whose name is
 * myPackage.Foo
 * boolean successful=cc.buildClosure("a.b.MyEjb");
 * successful=cc.buildClosure("a.b.YourEjb") && successful; //note the order of
 * &&.
 * Collection closure=cc.getClosure();//now closure contains the union of
 * closure for the two classes.
 * Map failed=cc.getFailed();//now failure contains the union of failures for
 * the two classes.
 * cc.reset();//clear the results collected so far so that we can start afresh.
 * //Now you can again start computing closure of another set of classes.
 * //The excluded stuff are still valid.
 * </pre></blockquote>
