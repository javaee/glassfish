 * Unit test for 6269102 ("SSL termination is not working, Appserver replaces
 * the https to http during redirection").
 *
 * This test
 *
 * - sets the authPassthroughEnabled property of http-listener-1 to TRUE [1],
 * - configures a server-name attribute for http-listener-1 with a value of
 *   https://lbhost:8888 [2],
 * - includes a 'Proxy-keysize' header with a value > 0 in the request [3],
 *
 * and expects that the host name and port# of the server-name attribute be
 * reflected in the Location response header, along with an https scheme
 * (due to [1] and [3] above). The https scheme in the server-name attribute
 * is ignored in this case.
