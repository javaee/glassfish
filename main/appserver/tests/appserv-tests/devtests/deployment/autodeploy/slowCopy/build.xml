    Note that this currently assumes that the ear/earwithejb and ejb/statelesshello projects have run to build 
    the ear used for this test.

    Also note that this test expects the 'grep' command to be present in the operating environment.
    This is fine on Solaris and Linux systems, and should be fine on Windows systems prepared 
    according to the requirements for building the app server.

            The next property setting represents a 4-second delay between
            writes to the autodeployed file (by the SlowCopy test class invoked
            below).  This is based on the 2-second
            interval with which the autodeploy thread rechecks the files
            in the autodeploy directory.  By using a setting significantly
            longer than the 2-second autodeploy period, we test two code paths in the
            autodeploy code. 
            
            One code path suppresses a retry of the file
            if it has failed to open successfully as an archive previously
            and has grown in size since the last check of the file.  The
            assumption in this case is that, since the file has grown since the
            last check, it might continue to grow and so we decide not to 
            retry it at that moment.
            
            The other code path detects runs when the
            size has not changed since the last check.  This set of logic
            then tries to open the file as an archive
            again.  (Here, the assumption is that since the file did
            not grow since the previous check, it might be done growing and
            therefore it makes sense to try to open it again now).  
            For most of the iterations, this code path finds that the archive 
            still will not open correctly - because the slow copy is still
            in progress - and does not further work with the file in the
            current iteration but leaves the file in the map of files to be
            monitored.  
            
            At last, when the copy completes, an iteration discovers that
            the file size has been stable since the last time through and
            the attempt to open the file as an archive succeeds.  The file
            is then autodeployed normally.
