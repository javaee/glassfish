/**
 * An implementation of the <code>ProxyServices</code> Service.
 * 
 * This implementation uses the thread context classloader (the application 
 * classloader) as the classloader for loading the bean proxies. The classloader
 * that loaded the Bean must be used to load and define the bean proxy to handle
 * Beans with package-private constructor as discussed in WELD-737. 
 *  
 * Weld proxies today have references to some internal weld implementation classes
 * such as javassist and org.jboss.weld.proxy.* packages. These classes are 
 * temporarily re-exported through the weld-integration-fragment bundle so that
 * when the bean proxies when loaded using the application classloader will have
 * visibility to these internal implementation classes.
 * 
 * As a fix for WELD-737, Weld may use the Bean's classloader rather than asking
 * the ProxyServices service implementation. Weld also plans to remove the 
 * dependencies of the bean proxy on internal implementation classes. When that
 * happens we can remove the weld-integration-fragment workaround and the 
 * ProxyServices implementation
