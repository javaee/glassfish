 * - Resource allocation is deferred to save - there is no need to worry about
 * resource cleanup if an IOException is thrown from other methods (addImport, 
 * setPackage, addClass).
 * - Any implementation of this interface must handle the closing of resources
 * during save if an exception is thrown.

 *<p>
 * Use this interface in conjunction with one or more {@link JavaClassWriter} 
 * instances to describe the class(es) in a java file.
