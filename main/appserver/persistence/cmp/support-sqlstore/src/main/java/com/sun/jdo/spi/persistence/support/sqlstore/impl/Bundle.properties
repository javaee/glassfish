# resource bundle for runtime messages
# key consists of: <subpackage>.<class>.<method>.<description>
# <subpackage> - is optional, package under runtime
# <class> - class name
# <method> - method name
# <description> - short description (use _ to represent space)
# all keys should be in lowercase
#
# The message ID for a message in persistence is derived as follows:
# JDO<2_digit_bundle_prefix><1_digit_section_number><2_digit_serial_number>
#
# The 2 digit prefix for this bundle is 77.
# 
# When adding a new message:
# 1. Please make sure that you add the message to the end of the file.
# 2. Please add message ID to any user visible message.
# 3. The message ID for the new message = message ID for the last numbered 
#    message in the file + 1.
# 4. Please do not change message number for existing messages. These numbers 
#    are potentially mapped to more explanation about the message for the end 
#    user.
