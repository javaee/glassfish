 * A class that can be managed by a JDO implementation.
 *
 * <P>Every class whose instances can be managed by a JDO PersistenceManager must 
 * implement the PersistenceCapable interface.
 *
 * <P>This interface defines methods that allow the implementation to manage
 * the instances.  It also defines methods that allow a JDO aware
 * application to examine the runtime state of instances.  For example,
 * an application can discover whether the instance is persistent, transactional,
 * dirty, new, or deleted; and to get its associated
 * PersistenceManager if it has one.
 *
 * <P>In the Reference Implementation, the JDO Enhancer modifies the class
 * to implement PersistenceCapable prior to loading the class into the runtime
 * environment.  The Reference Enhancer also adds code to implement the
 * methods defined by PersistenceCapable.
 *
 * <P>The PersistenceCapable interface is designed to avoid name conflicts
 * in the scope of user-defined classes.  All of its declared method
 * names are prefixed with 'jdo'.
