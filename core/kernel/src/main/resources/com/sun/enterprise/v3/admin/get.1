NAME
     get - gets the values of  the  monitorable  or  configurable
     attributes

SYNOPSIS
     get
     [--terse={true|false}][ --echo={true|false} ]
     [ --interactive={true|false} ] [ --host  host]
     [--port port] [--secure| -s ] [ --user  admin_user]
     [--passwordfile filename] [--help]
      [ --monitor =[true|false]]
      (dotted_attribute_name)+

DESCRIPTION
     Gets the names and values of attributes.  If  the  --monitor
     option  is  set  to  true,  the  monitorable  attributes are
     returned. If the --monitor option is set to false, the  con-
     figurable  attribute values are returned. On UNIX platforms,
     if the shell treats the wildcard (*) as a special character,
     enclose the dotted name in a double quotes ("dotted_name").

     The asadmin get, set and list commands  work  in  tandem  to
     provide  a navigation mechanism for the Application Server's
     abstract hierarchy. There  are two  hierarchies:  configura-
     tion  and monitoring and these commands operate on both. The
     list command provides the fully qualified  dotted  names  of
     the  management components that have read-only or modifiable
     attributes. The configuration hierarchy provides  attributes
     that  are  modifiable;  whereas the attributes of management
     components from monitoring hierarchy are  purely  read-only.
     The configuration hierarchy is loosely based on the domain's
     schema document; whereas the monitoring hierarchy is a  lit-
     tle  different.  Use  the list command to reach a particular
     management component in the desired hierarchy. Then,  invoke
     the  get and set commands to get the names and values or set
     the values of the attributes of the management component  at
     hand.  Use the wildcard (*) option to fetch all matches in a
     given fully qualified dotted  name.  See  the  examples  for
     further  clarification  of  the  possible  navigation of the
     hierarchies and management components.

     An application server dotted name uses the "." (period) as a
     delimiter  to separate the parts of a complete name. This is
     similar to how the "/" character is used to delimit the lev-
     els  in  the  absolute  path name of a file in the UNIX file
     system. The following rules apply while forming  the  dotted
     names  accepted by the get, set and list commands. Note that
     a specific command has some additional semantics applied.

         o     A . (period) always separates two sequential parts
              of the name.

         o    A part of the name usually identifies  an  applica-
              tion server subsystem and/or its specific instance.
              For example:  web-container,  log-service,  thread-
              pool-1 etc.

         o    If any  part  of  the  name  itself  contains  a  .
              (period),  then  it  must be escaped with a leading
              \fR (backslash) so that the "." does not act like a
              delimiter.

         o    An * (asterisk) can be used anywhere in the  dotted
              name  and  it  acts  like the wildcard character in
              regular expressions. Additionally, an  *  can  col-
              lapse all the parts of the dotted name. Long dotted
              name like  "this.is.really.long.hierarchy"  can  be
              abbreviated to "th*.hierarchy". But note that the .
              always delimits the parts of the name.

         o    The top level switch for any dotted name is  -moni-
              tor  or  -m that is separately specified on a given
              command line. The presence or lack of  this  switch
              implies the selection of one of the two hierarchies
              for appserver management: monitoring and configura-
              tion.

         o    If you happen to know  the  exact  complete  dotted
              name  without any wildcard character, then list and
              get/set have a little difference  in  their  seman-
              tics:

             o    The list command treats  this  complete  dotted
                  name  as  the complete name of a parent node in
                  the abstract  hierarchy.  Upon  providing  this
                  name  to  list  command,  it simply returns the
                  names of the immediate children at that  level.
                  For   example,   list  server.applications.web-
                  module will list all the web  modules  deployed
                  to the domain or the default server.

             o    The get and set commands  treat  this  complete
                  dotted  name as the fully qualified name of the
                  attribute of a node (whose dotted  name  itself
                  is  the  name  that you get when you remove the
                  last part of this dotted name) and it gets/sets
                  the  value  of  that attribute. This is true if
                  such an attribute exists. You will never  start
                  with this case because in order to find out the
                  names of attributes of a particular node in the
                  hierarchy,  you must use the wildcard character

                  *.   For   example,    server.applications.web-
                  module.JSPWiki.context-root   will  return  the
                  context-root of the web-application deployed to
                  the domain or default server.

         o    server(usually the first part of the complete  dot-
              ted  name)  can be replaced with the name of a par-
              ticular server instance of interest (e.g., server1)
              and  you'll  get  the  information  of  that server
              instance, remaining part of the dotted name remain-
              ing  the  same. Note that the dotted names that are
              available in such other server instances are  those
              from  the monitoring hierarchy because these server
              instances don't have a way to expose the configura-
              tion hierarchy.

     The list command is the progenitor of navigational capabili-
     ties  of  these  three  commands.  If you want to set or get
     attributes of a particular application server subsystem, you
     must know its dotted name. The list command is the one which
     can guide you to find the dotted name of that subsystem. For
     example, to find out the modified date (attribute) of a par-
     ticular file in a large file  system  that  starts  with  /.
     First  you  must  find  out the location of that file in the
     file system, and then look at its attributes. Therefor,  two
     of  the  first  commands  to  understand  the hierarchies in
     appserver are: * list "*" and * list * -monitor. The  sorted
     output of these commands is typically of the following form:

              of a management component that is capable of having
              attributes. Note that none of these lines show  any
              kind of attributes at all.

     The output of thelist command is  a  list  of  dotted  names
     representing  individual  application  server components and
     subsystems. Every component or subsystem is capable of  hav-
     ing zero or more attributes that can be read and modified.

     Making use of both list and get commands, it is straightfor-
     ward to reach a particular component of interest.

     To get the monitoring information of a particular  subsystem
     you must:

         1.   Use the set command to set an appropriate  monitor-
              ing level for the component of interest.

         2.   Obtain the various information about the  JVM  that
              the application server domain is running.

                                              at all. Logically, you try the
                                              next    one   and   that   is:

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This
         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,
         http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number for administration is 4848.

     -s --secure

         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

         The default is false.

     -u --user
         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile

         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration
         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be specified by one of the fol-
         lowing means:

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

             o    Through the asadmin login command

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

Administration Commands                                    get(1)

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin
         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --monitor
         defaults to false; if set  to  false,  the  configurable
         attribute values are returned. If set to true, the moni-

     Example 2 Using get with the monitor option

     To get the monitoring data from  the  domain  administration
     server,  the appropriate monitoring level must be set on the
     appropriate subsystem. Use the set command to set the  moni-
     toring  data level. For example, to set the monitoring level
     on Web Container on Domain Administration  Server  (DAS)  to
     HIGH  so  that  the  Web  Container returns many monitorable
     attributes    and    their    values:     server.monitoring-
     service.module-monitoring-levels.web-container=HIGH. See the
     set command for further details on  setting  the  monitoring
     level.
