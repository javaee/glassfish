NAME
     create-service -  configures the starting of a DAS  or  node
     agent on an unattended boot.

DESCRIPTION
     Configures the starting of a DAS or node agent on  an  unat-
     tended  boot.  On  Solaris 10, this command uses the Service
     Management Facility (SMF). This is  a  local  command.  This
     command  must  be  run  as  the OS-level user with superuser
     privileges. For AS 9.0, this is available only  for  Solaris
     10.  This  command  creates  the service and the user has to
     start, enable, disable, delete, or  stop  the  service.  The
     DAS/node-agent  configuration  must be stored on a folder to
     which the super-user has access. The configuration cannot be
     stored  on  a  network file system. This command creates the
     service such that it is controlled by the OS-level user, who
     owns  the  folder where the configuration of the DAS or node
     agent resides.

     To run this command, you must have solaris.smf.*  authoriza-
     tion.  See  the useradd and usermod manpages to find out how
     to set the authorizations. It  is  also  essential  for  the
     users  to  have  write  permission  in  the  directory tree:
     /var/svc/manifest/application/SUNWappserver.  Usually,   the
     super-user  has both these permissions. If one wishes to run
     these commands as non-root user, then the system administra-
     tor  must  be  contacted so that the relevant authorizations
     are granted.

     You need to also ensure that:

         o    Solaris 10 administration commands such as  svccfg,
              svcs,  and auths are available in the PATH, so that
              these commands can be executed. A simple test to do
              so  is to issue the command, which svccfg on a bash
              shell.

         o    You should have  write  permission  for  the  path,
              /var/svc/manifest/application.

OPTIONS

         containing  the  password entries in a specified format.
         The entry for the password  must have the AS_ADMIN_ pre-
         fix  followed  by  the password name in capital letters.
         For example, to specify the domain administration server
         password,  use  an  entry  with  the  following  format:
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password, where password is the actual
         administrator  password.  Other  passwords  that  can be
         specified        include        AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -e --echo

         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -t --terse
         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     --name

          Indicates the name of the  service  and  overrides  the
         default, if present.

     --type
          Specifies whether the service pertains to DAS  or  node
         agent.  Valid  values  are  das  and  node-agent and the
         default value is das, indicating that the user's  domain
         will be created as a service by default.

     --serviceproperties

          Specifies a colon(:)-separated list of various  proper-
         ties  that  are specific to the service. For Solaris 10,
         if you specify  net_privaddr,  the  service's  processes
         will  be able to bind to the privileged ports (<1024) on
         the platform. You can bind to ports< 1024  only  if  the
         owner of the service is super-user, this is not allowed.
         If you specify startinstances=true/false, when the  type
         is  node-agent,  all  the instances are started when the
         node-agent starts up.
