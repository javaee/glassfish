DESCRIPTION
     Use the create-domain command to  create  an  administrative
     domain.

     This  command creates  the  configuration  of  a  domain.  A
     domain  is  an  administrative namespace. Every domain has a
     configuration, which is stored in a set of files. Any number
     of domains each of which has a distinct administrative iden-
     tity can be created in a given installation  of  application
     server.  A  domain  can exist  independent of other domains.
     Any user who has access to the asadmin script  on  a   given
     system  can create a domain and store its configuration in a
     folder of choice. By default, the  domain  configuration  is
     created  in the default directory for domains. You can over-
     ride this location to store the configuration elsewhere.

     A domain, in addition to being an  administrative  boundary,
     is  also  a  fully compliant Java EE Server. This means that
     you can deploy your Java EE  Applications to the domain  and
     run  them  when the domain is started. A domain provides all
     the necessary environment and services that are essential to
     run the applications.

     A domain can be managed by tools such as the  Administration
     GUI or asadmin.

     This command is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --user

         The username of the administrator of the domain.

asadmin Utility Subcommands                      create-domain(1)

     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     --domaindir
         The directory where the domain  is  to  be  created.  If
         specified,  the  path must be accessible in the filesys-
         tem. If not specified, the  domain  is  created  in  the
         default domain directory.

     --profile

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --template
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --adminport

         The HTTP/S port for  administration. This is the port to
         which   you   should   point   your  browser   (example,
         http://localhost:this-port) to manage the domain.

         Either the --adminport option or the  --portbase  option
         must be specified.

     --portbase

         Determines the number with  which  the  port  assignment
         should  start.  A  domain uses a certain number of ports
         that are statically assigned. The portbase value  deter-
         mines  where  the  assignment  should start. Choose this
         value judiciously. The values for the ports  are  calcu-
         lated  as  follows:  Admin  port:  portbase  +  48, HTTP
         listener port: portbase + 80, IIOP listener port:  port-
         base  +  37,  JMX port: portbase + 86. See the output of
         this command for a complete list of occupied ports, when
         --portbase option is specified.

         Note -

           This command uses some ports that  are  not  required.
           This behavior is retained for compatibility with other
           releases.
         Either the --adminport option or the  --portbase  option
         must be specified.

         Note -

           The --portbase option  cannot  be  used  with  the  --
           adminport or the --instanceport option.

     --passwordfile
         The file containing the domain application server  pass-
         word  associated  with  the administrative instance. The
         create-domain command reads values for AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD
         and AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD from this file. The password
         is     defined     in      the      following      form:
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password, where password is the actual
         administrator password for the  domain.  This  file  can
         contain  many  other  passwords  required by the asadmin
         commands. In adherence to  application  server  security
         policy,  asadmin does not accept clear text passwords on
         the command line.

         If AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD or AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD  is  not
         in  the password file, the create-domain command prompts
         for admin password and master password.

     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

asadmin Utility Subcommands                      create-domain(1)

     --instanceport

         As noted above, the  domain provides  services  so  that
         applications  can  run  when  deployed. This (HTTP) port
         specifies where the  web application context  roots  are
         available for a Web browser to connect to. This port  is
         a positive integer and must be available at the time  of
         creation of the domain.

     --savemasterpassword
         Setting this option to true allows the masterpassword to
         be written to the file system. Default is false.

         A master password is really a password  for  the  secure
         key  store. A domain is designed to keep  its own certi-
         ficate (created at the time of  domain  creation)  in  a
         safe place in  the configuration location. This certifi-
         cate is called domain's SSL server certificate. When the
         domain is contacted by a Web browser over a secure chan-
         nel  (HTTPS),  this  certificate  is  presented  by  the
         domain.  The master password is supposed to protect this
         store (a file) that contains this certificate. This file
         is  called  keystore.jks  and  is  created in the config
         directory of the domain created. If however, this option
         is   chosen, the master password is saved on the disk in
         domain's configuration location. The  master password is
         stored in a file called master-password, which is a Java
         JCEKS type  keystore. The only advantage of  using  this
         option  is in case of unattended system  boots, where at
         the time of start-domain, the  master  password  is  not
         prompted  for,   because  it will be extracted from this
         file.

         It is best to create a masterpassword  when  creating  a
         domain,  because  masterpassword  is  used by the start-
         domain command. For security purposes, the default  set-
         ting  should be false, because saving the masterpassword
         on the disk is an insecure practice, unless file  system
         permissions  are  properly  set.  If  masterpassword  is
         saved, then start-domain will not prompt for it. Master-
         password  gives  an  extra  level  of  security  to  the
         environment.

     --domainproperties

         Setting the  optional  name/value  pairs  overrides  the
         default  values  for  the properties of the domain to be
         created. The list must be separated by the :  character.
         The following properties are available:

asadmin Utility Subcommands                      create-domain(1)

         jms.port

             Specifies the port number for JMS.  Valid  value  is
             7676.

         domain.jmxPort
             Specifies the port on which  the  JMX  connector  is
             initialized. The valid values are 1-65535.

         orb.listener.port

             Specifies the ORB listener port   for  IIOP  connec-
             tions on which orb-listener-1 listens.

         http.ssl.port
             Specifies the port number for http-listener-2. Valid
             values  are  1  to 65535. On UNIX, to create sockets
             that listen on  ports  1-1024,  you  need  superuser
             privileges.

         orb.ssl.port

             Specifies the ORB listener port for IIOP connections
             on which the IIOP listener called SSL listens.

         orb.mutualauth.port
             Specifies the ORB listener port for IIOP connections
             on  which  the  IIOP  listener called SSL_MUTUALAUTH
             listens.

     --keytooloptions

         Specifies an optional list of name-value pairs  of  key-
         tool  options  for a self-signed server certificate. The
         certificate is generated  during  the  creation  of  the
         domain.  Each  pair in the list must be separated by the
         colon character (:).

         Allowed options are as follows:

         CN
             Specifies the common name of the host that is to  be
             used  for  the  self-signed certificate. This option
             name is case insensitive.

asadmin Utility Subcommands                      create-domain(1)

             By default, the name is the fully-qualified name  of
             the machine where the create-domain command is run.

      --savelogin

         Saves the admin user name and password if you  set  this
         option to true. The default value is false. The username
         and password are stored  in  the  .asadminpass  file  in
         user's  home  directory.  A  domain  can only be created
         locally and hence while using the above option, the host
         name  saved in .asadminpass will always be localhost. If
         the user has specified default admin port while creating
         the  domain,  there  is  no  need  to specify --user, --
         passwordfile, --host, or --port on any of the subsequent
         asadmin  remote commands. These values will be automati-
         cally obtained.

         Note -

           When the same user  creates  multiple  domains  having
           same  admin  port  number  on  the  same  or different
           machines (where the home directory  is  NFS  mounted),
           the  command  is not going to prompt whether the pass-
           word  should  be  overwritten.  It  will   always   be
           overwritten.

OPERANDS
     domain_name                 The name of  the  domain  to  be
