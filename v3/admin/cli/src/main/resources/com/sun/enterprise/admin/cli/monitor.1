NAME
     monitor - displays monitoring data for  commonly  used  com-
     ponents and services

SYNOPSIS
     monitor [--help] --type monitor-type  [--interval interval] [--filter filter_name] instance-name

DESCRIPTION
     The monitor subcommand displays statistics for commonly mon-
     itored Enterprise Server components and services. The --type
     option must be used to specify the object for which  statis-
     tics  are to be displayed. Data is displayed continuously in
     a tabular form, or the data can be displayed at a particular
     time interval by using the --interval option.

     Before a given component or service can be monitored,  moni-
     toring  must  be  enabled  (set to HIGH or LOW) for the com-
     ponent or service by using the Administration  Console,  the
     enable-monitoring subcommand, or the set subcommand.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS

     --type
