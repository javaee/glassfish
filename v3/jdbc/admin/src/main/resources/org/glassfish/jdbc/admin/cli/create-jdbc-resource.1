DESCRIPTION
     The  create-jdbc-resource  command  creates   a   new   JDBC
     resource. This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This
         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,
         http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number for administration is 4848.

Administration Commands                   create-jdbc-resource(1)

     -s --secure

         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

         The default is false.

     -u --user
         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile

         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration
         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be specified by one of the fol-
         lowing means:

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

             o    Through the asadmin login command

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

Administration Commands                   create-jdbc-resource(1)

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin
         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the com-
         mand  runs  successfully  and  the  option  is  silently
         ignored.

     --connectionpoolid

         The name of the JDBC connection pool.  If  two  or  more
         JDBC resource elements point to the same connection pool
         element, they use the same pool connection at runtime.

     --enabled
         Determines whether the JDBC resource is enabled at  run-
         time. The default value is true.

     --description

         Text  providing  descriptive  details  about  the   JDBC
         resource.

     --property
         Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring  the
         resource.
