asadmin Utility Subcommands           create-system-properties(1)

NAME
     create-system-properties - adds one or more overridable sys-
     tem property elements at the server level

SYNOPSIS
     create-system-properties [--help] [--target target-name] [name=value)[:name=value]*]

DESCRIPTION
     The create-system-properties subcommand adds or updates  the
     system  properties  that  can be referenced elsewhere on the
     server. Any configuration attribute in a server instance can
     be overridden through a system property of the corresponding
     name.

     Enterprise Server provides hooks where tokens  (system  pro-
     perties)  can  be  specified. Because Enterprise Server does
     not have multiple server elements, you can specify a partic-
     ular  token  at  any  level. When a domain supports multiple
     servers, the override potential can  be  exploited.  When  a
     domain  is  started or restarted, all <system-property> ele-
     ments are resolved and available to the Java Virtual Machine
     by using the System.setProperty() call on each of them (with
     its name and value derived from the corresponding attributes
     of  the  element). This is analogous to sending the elements
     as -D parameters on the Java command line.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     name=value

         The name value pairs of the system properties to add  to
         the specified target. Multiple system properties must be
         separated by a : (colon). If a : (colon) appears in  the
         name  or  value of a system property, it must be escaped
