NAME
     rotate-log - rotates the log file

SYNOPSIS
     rotate-log [--help]

DESCRIPTION
     The rotate-log subcommand rotates the server log by renaming
     the   file   with   a   timestamp   name   in   the   format
     server.log_date-and-time,  and  creating  a  new  log  file.
     Changes  take effect dynamically, that is, server restart is
     not required.

     The size of  the  log  queue  is  configurable  through  the
     logging.properties  file,  and log rotation is based on file
     size or elapsed time since the last log  rotation.  In  some
     circumstances,  the  queue  might fill up, especially if the
     log level is set to FINEST and there is  heavy  activity  on
     the  server.  In this case, the rotate-log subcommand can be
     used to rotate the server log immediately.  This  subcommand
     is  also  useful in creating scripts for rotating the log at
     convenient times.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
