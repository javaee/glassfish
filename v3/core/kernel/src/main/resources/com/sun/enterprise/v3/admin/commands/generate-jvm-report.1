NAME
     generate-jvm-report - shows the  threads,  classes,  memory,
     and loggers for a given target instance.

SYNOPSIS
     generate-jvm-report
     [--terse={true|false}][ --echo={true|false} ]
     [ --interactive={true|false} ] [ --host  host]
     [--port port] [--secure| -s ] [ --user  admin_user]
     [--passwordfile filename] [--help]
     [ --type =summary|memory|class|thread|log] [target]

DESCRIPTION
     This command creates a report that shows the  threads  (dump
     of  stack  trace),  classes,  memory, or loggers for a given
     target instance, including the domain administration  server
     (DAS).  This  command works only with the application server
     instance processes.

     This command provides an alternative to  sending  Ctrl+Break
     or kill -3 signals to application server processes to obtain
     a stack trace for processes that are hanging.

     The information in the report is obtained from managed beans
     (MBeans) and MXBeans that are provided in the Java Platform,
     Standard Edition (Java SE ) or  JDKTM  software  with  which
     Sun GlassFishTM Enterprise Server is being used.

     If Enterprise Server is running in the Java Runtime Environ-
     ment  (JRETM)  software  from   JDK  release 6 or Java SE 6,
     additional information is provided, for example:

         o    System load on the available processors

         o    Object  monitors  that  are   currently   held   or
              requested by a thread

         o    Lock objects that a thread is holding, for example,
              ReentrantLock  objects  and  ReentrantReadWriteLock
              objects

     If the JRE software cannot  provide  this  information,  the
     report contains the text NOT_AVAILABLE.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.  The  command
     does not work if the target server instance is not running.

Administration Commands                    generate-jvm-report(1)

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This
         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,
         http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number for administration is 4848.

     -s --secure
         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

         The default is false.

     -u --user

         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

Administration Commands                    generate-jvm-report(1)

     --passwordfile

         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration
         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be specified by one of the fol-
         lowing means:

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

             o    Through the asadmin login command

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin
         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

OPERANDS
     target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the com-
         mand  runs  successfully  and  the  option  is  silently
         ignored.
