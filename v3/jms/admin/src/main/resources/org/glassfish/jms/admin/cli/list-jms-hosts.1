DESCRIPTION
     The list-jms-hosts command lists the existing JMS hosts  for
     the  JMS  service.  This command is supported in remote mode
     only.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the
                             following                    format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The  port  number  of   the   domain
                             administration  server listening for
                             administration requests. The default
                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-

                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -h --help               Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.
