DESCRIPTION
     The create-http-listener subcommand creates an HTTP  network
     listener. This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

     Note -

       If you  edit  the  special  HTTP  network  listener  named
       admin-listener,  you  must  restart  the  server  for  the
       changes to take effect. The  Administration  Console  does
       not tell you that a restart is required in this case.

     Note -

       This subcommand is provided for backward compatibility and
       as  a shortcut for creating network listeners that use the
       HTTP protocol. Behind the scenes, this subcommand  creates
       a network listener and its associated protocol, transport,
       and HTTP configuration.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --listeneraddress
         The IP address or the hostname (resolvable by DNS).

     --listenerport

         The port number to create the listen  socket  on.  Legal
         values  are  1-65535.  On  UNIX,  creating  sockets that

         listen on ports 1-1024  requires  superuser  privileges.
         Configuring  an  SSL listen socket to listen on port 443
         is recommended.

     --default-virtual-server or --defaultvs

         The ID attribute of the default virtual server for  this
         listener. The --defaultvs option is deprecated.

     --servername
         Tells the server what to put in the host name section of
         any  URLs  it sends to the client. This affects URLs the
         server automatically generates; it  doesn't  affect  the
         URLs  for  directories  and  files stored in the server.
         This name should be the alias name if your  server  uses
         an  alias. If a colon and port number are appended, that
         port will be used in URLs that the server sends  to  the
         client.

     --acceptorthreads

         The number of acceptor threads for the listener  socket.
         The recommended value is the number of processors in the
         machine. The default value is 1.

     --xpowered
         If set to true, adds the X-Powered-By:  Servlet/2.4  and
         X-Powered-By:   JSP/2.0   headers   to  the  appropriate
         responses. The Servlet 2.4 specification defines the  X-
         Powered-By: Servlet/2.4 header, which containers may add
         to servlet-generated responses. Similarly, the  JSP  2.0
         specification  defines the X-Powered-By: JSP/2.0 header,
         which containers may add to responses that use JSP tech-
         nology.   The goal of these headers is to aid in gather-
         ing statistical data  about the use of Servlet  and  JSP
         technology.

     --redirectport

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --securityenabled

         If set to true, the HTTP listener runs SSL. You can turn
         SSL2 or SSL3 ON or OFF and set ciphers using an SSL ele-
         ment. The security setting globally enables or  disables
         SSL  by  making  certificates  available  to  the server
         instance. The default value is false.

     --enabled
         If set to true, the listener is enabled at runtime.

     --target

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     listener_id                 The listener ID of the HTTP net-
                                 work listener.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using the create-http-listener subcommand

     The following command creates an HTTP network listener named
     sampleListener  that  uses  a non-default number of acceptor
     threads and is not enabled at runtime:

       asadmin> create-http-listener --listeneraddress 0.0.0.0 --listenerport 7272
       --defaultvs server --servername host1.sun.com --acceptorthreads 100
       --securityenabled=false --enabled=false sampleListener
       Command create-http-listener executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
     0                           command executed successfully

     1                           error in executing the command
