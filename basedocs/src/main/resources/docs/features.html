<h1>Features and Resources </h1>

<p class="feature">The Sun Java System Application Server
9.1 provides a Java EE compatible server for the development 
and deployment of Java EE applications and Java Web Services.
Key features include scalable transaction management, 
container-managed persistence runtime, performant web 
services, clustering, high availability, security, and 
integration capabilities.

<p class="feature">This page contains the following topics:</p>

</UL>


<a name="key-features"></a><H2>Key Features</H2>
<p class="feature"><b>Java EE 5 platform support</b>:
Sun Java System Application Server 9.1 complies fully
with the latest Java EE 5 specification to deliver one of the best
application runtimes for next-generation enterprise applications and web services.
Application Server 9.1 implements and extends the following Java EE standards:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise Java Beans 3.0
<li>JAXB 2.0
<li>Java Persistence
<li>Java Server Faces 1.2
<li>Java Server Pages 2.1 (JSP 2.1)
<li>Java Server Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) 1.2
<li>Streaming API for XML (StAX)
<li>Web Services Metadata
<li>Java API for XML based Web Services 2.0 (JAX-WS 2.0)
<li>Common Annotations for the Java Platform 1.0 (CAJ 1.0)
<li>And more...for a complete list of the Java EE technologies
included, see the <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-3666">Release Notes</a>.
</ul>


<p class="feature"><b>Web Services Interoperability Technologies (WSIT) Support</b>
<BR>
Sun is working closely with Microsoft to ensure interoperability of 
Web services enterprise technologies such as message optimization, reliable 
messaging, and security. The initial release of WSIT is a product of this 
joint effort. WSIT is an implementation of a number of open web services 
specifications to support enterprise features. In addition to message 
optimization, reliable messaging, and security, WSIT includes a bootstrapping 
and configuration technology. Starting with the core XML support currently 
built into the Java platform, WSIT uses or extends existing features and 
adds new support for interoperable web services, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrapping and Configuration
<li>Message Optimization Technology
<li>Reliable Messaging Technology
<li>Security Technology
</ul>

<p class="feature"><b>Java Business Integration (JBI) Support</b><br>
JBI extends Java EE with business integration Service Provider 
Interfaces (SPI). These SPI enable developers to create or implement 
a Java business integration environment for specifications such as 
WSCI, PBEL4WS and the W3C Choreography Working Group. A JBI 
implementation is installed directly by the Application Server 
installer, mostly in the <code>AS_HOME/jbi</code> directory. 
This directory contains all common JAR files and system components 
for the JBI including a <code>lifecycle</code> module that starts
the JBI framework in the Application Server JVM.</p>

<p class="feature"><b>In-Memory Replication Support</b><br>
In-memory replication on other servers provides lightweight 
storage of session state data without the need to obtain a 
separate database, such as HADB. This type of replication 
uses memory on other servers for high availability storage 
of HTTP session and stateful session bean data. Clustered 
server instances replicate session state in a ring of 
topology. Each backup instance stores the replicated data 
in memory. Replication of session state data in memory on 
other servers enables sessions to be distributed. The use
of in-memory replication requires the Group Management 
Service (GMS) to be enabled.</p>

<p class="feature"><b>Usage Profiles Support</b><br>
Every administrative domain is associated with a usage profile 
which identifies the capabilities of that domain. Application 
Server 9.1 provides the following profiles:
<ul>
<li><i>Developer</i> Use this profile if you are running your 
domain in a development environment and if your applications 
do not need the NSS keystore or clustering features, such as 
load balancing, high availability, and session replication.
<li><i>Cluster</i> Use this profile if you need to create 
clusters but do not require the high-availability database (HADB) 
or the NSS keystore.
<li><i>Enterprise</i> Use this profile if you need HADB and NSS.
This profile is not usable unless you install HADB and NSS 
separately or install the Application Server as part of the 
Java Enterprise System (Java ES).
</ul>

<p class="feature"><b>Load Balancing Enhancements</b><br>
Several enhancements have been added to the load balancing 
plugin including:
<ul>
<li><i>Weighted Round Robin</i> An optional attribute called 
<code>weight</code> has been added to the instance <code>Loadbalancer.xml</code>
file. This option enables the load balancer plugin to route requests according 
to the weight. For example, for every 500 requests, 100 will go to <code>instance1</code>
and 400 would go to <code>instance2</code>. The default weight is 100. The weight is
assigned to each instance from the Administration Console or command-line. In addition, the 
server <code>domain.xml</code> file identifies an attribute for every instance 
indicating the weight.
<p>
<li><i>User-Defined Load Balancer Decision</i> Enables users to define custom
logic for load balancing; for example, user identity-based redirects and mime-based
load balancing. This feature is implemented by means of user-defined shared library 
that gets loaded by the load balancer. This custom shared library implements the 
interface as defined in <code>loadbalancer.h</code>, which is placed in 
<code>appserv_install_dir/lir/install/templates/</code>.
<p>
<li><i>Administration Enhancements</i> Previous versions of Application Server 
required that the <code>loadbalancer.xml</code> file be manually copied to the 
particular server's <code>config</code> directory. Application Server 9.1 includes 
push automations for performing such copies between the Web Server and the 
Application Server. The load balancer itself is configured in the server's 
<code>domain.xml</code> file.
</ul>
<p>

<p class="feature"><b>Open Source and GlassFish Community</b><br>
In June 2005, Sun launched the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/glassfish/">GlassFish</a> 
community with the goal of developing a free, open source, commercial-grade application 
server that implements the newest features of the Java EE 5 platform and related enterprise 
technologies. Application Server 9.1 is based on the source code developed by Sun engineers 
and the GlassFish community.
