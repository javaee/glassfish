</table>  <h1>Features and Resources </h1>  <!--GlassFish v3 Application provides a Java EE compatible server for the development  and deployment of Java EE applications and Java Web Services. Key features include scalable transaction management, container-managed persistence runtime, high performance web  services, clustering, high availability, security, and  integration capabilities. --><p>
GlassFish v3 Application Server Technology Preview 2 provides a server that is compatible with the Java &trade; Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) for the development of web applications. Web applications that are developed by using GlassFish v3 Application Server Technology Preview 2 can
be deployed in earlier versions of the Application Server, for example, GlassFish v2 Application Server.</p><p>This page contains the following topics:</p> <ul>
<li><a href="#key-features">Key Features</a>   </li>
<li><a href="#resources">Resources</a></li>
</ul>   <a name="key-features"></a><h2>Key Features</h2><h3>Modularity and Extensibility</h3><p>The modular architecture of GlassFish v3 Application Server enables you to download and install only the modules that you require for the applications that you are deploying. As a result, start-up times,
memory consumption, and disk space requirements are all minimized. This modular architecture also enables the extension of the Application Server's basic functionality through addition of modules through the Update Center.</p> <h3>Scripting Language Support</h3><p>GlassFish v3 Application Server
Technology Preview 2 supports the Ruby scripting language by providing native support for JRuby. This support enables GlassFish v3 Application Server to be applied beyond developments that are centred on Java technology.</p><h3>Java EE 5 Web Tier Support</h3><!--GlassFish v3 Application Server complies fully with the latest Java EE 5 specification to deliver one of the best application runtimes for next-generation enterprise applications and web services. GlassFish v3 Application Server implements and extends the following Java EE standards: --><p>
GlassFish v3 Application Server Technology Preview 2 supports the web tier of the Java EE 5 specification to enable the deployment of web applications. GlassFish v3 Application Server implements and extends the following Java EE standards:</p><ul>
<!--Enterprise Java Beans 3.0-->
<li>JAXB 2.0</li>
<li>Java Persistence</li>
<li>Java Server Faces 1.2</li>
<li>Java Server Pages 2.1 (JSP 2.1)</li>
<li>Java Server Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) 1.2</li>
<li>Streaming API for XML (StAX)</li>
<!--Web Services Metadata-->
<li>Java API for XML based Web Services 2.0 (JAX-WS 2.0)</li>
<li>Common Annotations for the Java Platform 1.0 (CAJ 1.0)</li>
</ul><p>For a complete list of the Java EE technologies included, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc820-4494"><cite>Release Notes</cite></a>.</p>   <h3>Web Services Interoperability Technologies (WSIT) Support</h3><p> Sun is working closely with Microsoft to ensure interoperability of  Web
services enterprise technologies such as message optimization, reliable  messaging, and security. The initial release of WSIT is a product of this  joint effort. WSIT is an implementation of a number of open web services  specifications to support enterprise features. In addition to message  optimization,
reliable messaging, and security, WSIT includes a bootstrapping  and configuration technology. Starting with the core XML support currently  built into the Java platform, WSIT uses or extends existing features and  adds new support for interoperable web services, including:</p> <ul>
<li>Bootstrapping and Configuration</li>
<li>Message Optimization Technology</li>
<li>Reliable Messaging Technology</li>
<li>Security Technology</li>
</ul>  <!--Java Business Integration (JBI) Support JBI extends Java EE with business integration Service Provider  Interfaces (SPI). These SPI enable developers to create or implement  a Java business integration environment for specifications such as  WSCI, BPEL4WS and the W3C Choreography Working Group. A JBI  implementation is installed directly by the Application Server  installer, mostly in the as-install/jbi directory.  This directory contains all common JAR files and system components  for the JBI including a lifecycle module that starts the JBI framework in the Application Server JVM.--
>  <!--In-Memory Replication Support In-memory replication on other servers provides lightweight  storage of session state data without the need to obtain a  separate database, such as HADB. This type of replication  uses memory on other servers for high availability storage  of HTTP session and stateful session bean data. Clustered  server instances replicate session state in a ring of  topology. Each backup instance stores the replicated data  in memory. Replication of session state data in memory on  other servers enables sessions to be distributed. The use of in-memory replication requires the Group Management  Service (GMS) to be enabled.--
>  <!--Usage Profiles Support Every administrative domain is associated with a usage profile  which identifies the capabilities of that domain. Application  Server 9.1 Update 2 provides the following profiles:Developer Use this profile if you are running your  domain in a development environment and if your applications  do not need the NSS keystore or clustering features, such as  load balancing, high availability, and session replication.Cluster Use this profile if you need to create  clusters but do not require the high-availability database (HADB)  or the NSS keystore.Enterprise Use this profile if you need HADB and NSS. This profile is not usable unless you install HADB and NSS  separately or install the Application Server as part of the  Java Enterprise System (Java ES).--
>  <!--Load Balancing Enhancements Several enhancements have been added to the load balancing  plugin including:Weighted Round Robin An optional attribute called  weight has been added to the instance Loadbalancer.xml file. This option enables the load balancer plugin to route requests according  to the weight. For example, for every 500 requests, 100 will go to instance1 and 400 would go to instance2. The default weight is 100. The weight is assigned to each instance from the Administration Console or command-line. In addition, the  server domain.xml file identifies an attribute for every instance  indicating the weight. User-Defined Load Balancer Decision Enables users to define custom logic for load balancing; for example, user identity-based redirects and mime-based load balancing. This feature is implemented by means of user-defined shared library  that gets loaded by the load balancer. This custom shared library implements the  interface as defined in loadbalancer.h, which is placed in  as-install/lib/install/templates/. Administration Enhancements Previous versions of Application Server  required that the loadbalancer.xml file be manually copied to the  particular server's config directory. GlassFish v3 Application Server includes  push automations for performing such copies between the Web Server and the  Application Server. The load balancer itself is configured in the server's  domain.xml file.--
><h3>Open Source and GlassFish Community</h3><p> In June 2005, Sun launched the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/glassfish/">GlassFish</a>  community with the goal of developing a free, open source, commercial-grade application  server that implements the newest features of the Java EE 5 platform
and related enterprise  technologies. GlassFish v3 Application Server is based on the source code developed by Sun engineers  and the GlassFish community.</p>  <h2><a name="resources"></a>Resources</h2>  <h3>Feedback Submittal Form</h3><p class="resources"> Use the <a
