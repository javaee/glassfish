/**
 * This class defines API's for the test harness to induce
 * recovery by setting crash points (in the case of TM crashes)
 * and wait points (in the case of RM crashes).
 *
 * In order to induce TM crashes, the test harness sets the failure points
 * by calling setCrashPoint(), after transaction.begin() from each thread.
 * Thus, multiple threads involving different transactions can
 * set different points of failure, which will cause the TM to wait
 * at the failure points, until crash() method is invoked.
 * Note: Only those transactions calling setCrashPoint() will be affected.
 *
 * The crash() method needs to be invoked from a seperate
 * thread. The TM would increment TestRecovery.waitCount field to
 * indicate the total number of failure points reached.
 * When the waitCount reaches the expected value
 * (obtained through getWaitCount()), the test harness shall call crash().
 *
 * In order to test RM recovery, the
 * test harness sets the failure points by calling setWaitPoint(),
 * after transaction.begin() from each thread. The TM  waits at predefined
 * failure points for the stipulated time duration, during which the RM is
 * expected to crash; after which the TM will proceed with regular
 * completion (a human is expected to crash the RM manually during the
 * wait duration). As in the TM recovery case, the  waitCount will be
 * incremented to indicate the total number of failure points reached.
 *
 * If the RM does not crash during the stipulated time
 * duration, the TM will proceed with normal completion for the specific
 * transaction. It does not matter if the RM
 * comes back alive, since the TM would anyway retry completion.
 * Note: Only those transactions calling setWaitPoint() will be affected.
