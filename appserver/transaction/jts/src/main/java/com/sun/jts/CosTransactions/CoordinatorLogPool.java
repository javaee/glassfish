/**
 * The CoordinatorLogPool is used as a cache for CoordinatorLog objects.
 * This pool allows the re-use of these objects which are very expensive
 * to instantiate.
 *
 * The pool is used by replacing calls to 'new CoordinatorLog()' in the
 * TopCoordinator with calls to CoordinatorLogPool.getCoordinatorLog().
 * The getCoordinatorLog() method attempts to return a CoordinatorLog
 * from the pool. If the pool is empty it instantiates a new
 * CoordinatorLog. 
 *
 * Objects are re-used by calling CoordinatorLogPool.putCoordinatorLog()
 * to return a CoordinatorLog object back to the pool. At this time a
 * check is made to ensure that the internal pool size doesn't exceed a
 * pre set limit. If it does, then the object is discarded and not put
 * back into the pool.
 *
 * The pool was added to improve performance of transaction logging
