 * The NestingInfo interface provides operations that record all nesting
 * information relevant to a Coordinator, that is, the set of children
 * (SubCoordinators) and the sequence of ancestors (Coordinators/global IDs).
 * As an instance of this class may be accessed from multiple threads within a
 * process, serialisation for thread-safety is necessary in the
 * implementation. The information recorded in an instance of this class does
 * not need to be reconstructible in the case of a system failure as
 * subtransactions are not durable.
