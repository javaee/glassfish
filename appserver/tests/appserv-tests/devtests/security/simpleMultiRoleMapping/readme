This is a unit test for https://glassfish.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2475.
The goal is to make sure that lower-level mapping files are read, not
to test for role conflicts in the files.

The ejb module is only used indirectly. Mostly it's there to provide
a second module so that more than one mapping file is tested.
