- 2 main build targets all and all-oracle
  all runs tests against derby database
  all-oracle runs againsts oracle db
- Eventually would like to link oracle tests to the target 'all' as well
- change derby.db.name in config.properties  so that all developers can run
  the tests without impacting others
