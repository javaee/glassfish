It is important to note that S1AS must be run as root if Solaris realm is used.

The default setting assumes that there is a Solaris login guest
with password guest123.

If a different Solaris password is used for testing, please modify build.xml.

If a different Solaris user/password is used for testing, then please modify
descriptor/sun-application.xml and build.xml.
