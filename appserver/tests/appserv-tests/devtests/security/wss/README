UNIT TESTS ON SECURITY/WSS
==========================

FOR RUNNING THE SECURITY TESTS:
-------------------------------
1. Update appserv-tests/config.properties.
2. setup the following environment variable:
	S1AS_HOME
	APS_HOME
   as in Quicklook tests.
3. Start the domain
4. Simply type "ant all" from appserv-tests/devtests/security/wss
   and pipe the result to a file.
5. Examine the log file and make sure that all 42 tests pass.

NOTE:
-----
If there is a problem in running wsimport for wss tests, then please check
a) the line 127.0.0.1 is correct in /etc/hosts
b) $APS_HOME should not have "/" at the end

If the problem involves a proxy warning (when running on windows behind
a firewall), make sure the host name of your machine is in the list of
host names for which a proxy is not used in your internet options.
