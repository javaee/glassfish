- Test support for enabled beans' classes deployed as a standalone RAR
[test originally from connector1.5 test in Connectors developer tests]
section 12.1. Bean archives of JSR 299 spec:

"Bean classes of enabled beans must be deployed in bean archives.
â€¢ A library jar, EJB jar, application client jar or rar archive is a
bean archive if it has a file named beans.xml in the META-INF
directory."

In this test, a standalone RAR has a TestCDIBean Bean class. This is injected into a MDB in another ejb-jar in the EAR.

[Note: This test doesn't seem to work now -- need to investigate]
