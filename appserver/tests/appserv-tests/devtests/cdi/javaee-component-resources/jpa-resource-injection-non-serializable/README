    - type safe injection of JPA resources (EntityManagerFactory, EntityManager) 
    by declaring a resource by annotating a producer field wuth a 
    component environment injection annotation
    - test if injection of non-serializable resource like EntityManager is supported. This should not result in a deployment failure
