Test
- Use of Producer Methods to act as a source of injectable bean instances
- Use of producer methods and qualifiers to enable runtime polymorphism (runtime
selection of beans to inject)
    - The beans can either be programmatically instantiated (new)
    - or via Injection (if a request-scoped bean is injected and the producer 
    method is annotated session-scoped, use @New to create a new Dependent object)
