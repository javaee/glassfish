This test, when run with 'all' target performs the following steps:

- build
- setup
  - start-database
  - startDomain
  - setup-database (add jdbc resource for the timer resource and set it as the timer resource)
  - setup-cluster (create cluster of 2 instances, enable  resource in the cluster)

- run-test
  - deploy 
    - deploy-to-cluster - deploy application with the target 'c1' 
      (check logs to verify automatic timers are created on both instances of c1)
    - verify
    - call verify from c1in1, before calling getAllTimers(), call createProgrammaticTimer() for both EJBs:
      - 4 automatic timers: 2 persistent and 2 nonpersistent
      - 4 programmatic timers: 2 persistent and 2 nonpersistent
    - call verify from c1in2, no programmatic timers will be created this time:
      - 4 automatic timers: 2 persistent and 2 nonpersistent
      - 2 programmatic timers: 2 persistent
  - undeploy
    - undeploy-from-cluster - undeploy application from target 'c1' 

- unsetup
  - unsetup-cluster (stop and delete the cluster)
  - unsetup-database (remove resource and unset timer resource)
  - stop-database
  - stopDomain
