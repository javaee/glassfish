This test, when run with 'all' target performs the following steps:

- build

- run-test
  - deploy 
    - deploy application and deployment should be failed
  - undeploy
    - undeploy application if the test case failed

There are 2 classes under client:
- AppClient
  - the application client who is declaring ejb reference
- NegClient
  - the main class to invoke asadmin API to perform deployment and catch failure since this is a negative test.
