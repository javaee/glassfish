This test, when run with 'all' target performs the following steps:

- build
- setup
  - start-database
  - startDomain
  - setup-database (add jdbc resources and execute create.sql script on it)
  - setup-cluster (create cluster of 2 instances, change JMS type to LOCAL, enable resources in the cluster)

- deploy
- run
  - run-auto-recover (execute test for automatic transactions recover after instance restart)
    Test inserts 3 rows from in1 into the xa database and sends 3 messages to the MDB
    Instance in1 is killed  and restarted
    Sleep 25 seconds to allow for all processing to go through
    Expected result: 3 rows found in student table and 3 in the messages tables (recorded when the message is received)

- undeploy
- unsetup
  - unsetup-cluster (delete JMS resources, stop and delete the cluster, reset JMS type to EMBEDDED)
  - unsetup-database (drop tables and remove resources)
  - stop-database
  - stopDomain
