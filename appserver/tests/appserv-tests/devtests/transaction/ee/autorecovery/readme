This test, when run with 'all' target performs the following steps:

- build
- setup
  - start-database
  - startDomain
  - setup-database (add jdbc resources and execute create.sql script on 2 resorces)
  - setup-cluster (create cluster of 3 instances, enable resources in the cluster, set configs.c1-config.transaction-service.property.delegated-recovery=true, and deploy the application)

- run
  - run-recover (execute test for automatic transactions recover as a GMS notification handling)
    Test inserts 3 rows from in1 into the default and xa database
    Instance in1 is killed 
    Instance in2 or in3 (GMS decides) receives GMS failure recovery notification
    Sleep 85 seconds to allow for all processing to go through
    Expected result: 3 rows found in xa database

- unsetup
  - unsetup-cluster (undeploy the application, stop and delete the cluster)
  - unsetup-database (drop tables and remove resources)
  - stop-database
  - stopDomain
