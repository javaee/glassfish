This test, when run with 'all' target performs the following steps:

- build
- setup
  - start-database
  - startDomain
  - setup-database (add jdbc resources, execute create.sql script on 2 resorces, and set xa resource as the timer resource)
  - setup-cluster (create cluster of 2 instances, enable resources in the cluster, set configs.c1-config.transaction-service.property.delegated-recovery=true, and deploy the application)

- run
  - run-recover (execute test for automatic transactions recover and timer migration as a GMS notification handling)
    Programmatic timer is created on in1 in a separate method call to get it going
    3 rows are inserted on in1 into the default and xa databases
    Instance in1 is killed during 2PC of the insert
    Instance in2 receives GMS failure recovery notification
    Test sleeps 85 seconds to allow for all processing to go through
    Expected result: 3 rows found in xa database and 1 programmatic timer had been migrated to the new instance

- unsetup
  - unsetup-cluster (undeploy the application, stop and delete the cluster)
  - unsetup-database (drop tables and remove resources)
  - stop-database
  - stopDomain
