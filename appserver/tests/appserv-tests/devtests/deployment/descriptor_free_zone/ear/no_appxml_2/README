This test verifies the following functionalities:

1. deployment of an ear without application.xml
2. the correct identification of the type of the jar file if the 
   application.xml does not exist
3. this test also makes sure that the war can be located anywhere in the package,
   whereas the ejbs are only under directories not named "lib"
