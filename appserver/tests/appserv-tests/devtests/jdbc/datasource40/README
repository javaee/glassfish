This is a sample unit test to check which datasource is received.
1)
When AS is run in 1.6.x, DataSource with "unwrap()" method must be available.
When AS is run in 1.5.x, DataSource should not have  "unwrap()"  method.

2) Checks whether close() on a proxyObject closes appserver's wrapper connection

3) checks whether unwrap() on datasource returns appropriate db datasources

PS : This test will pass only in JDK 1.6.
Appserver need to run on JDK 1.6,
Derby JDBC 4.0 version is needed
