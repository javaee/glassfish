This is a simple unit test for getting a connection from mysql. 
test1: get 10 connections in a shot and then close them all
test2: get a single connection and close it
test2: get a connection and do some DB inserts and queries

-----------
1. mysql is up and running on your machine

2. A database called "mysqldb" is present in the installation
Use this command to do that:
mysql> CREATE DATABASE mysqldb;

3. a user "aditya" with password "aditya" has been added to the mysql
