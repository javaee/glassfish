Test for transparent dynamic reconfiguration of jdbc-connection-pool :

[Same as 'transparent-pool-reconfig' test, but uses glassfish-resources.xml, 
appropriate dotted-names-get/set for reconfiguration]

* Tests whether the connection-factory (DataSource) remains valid even after
  a hard reconfiguration (ie., User / Password property change for pool)
* Tests whether the changes are visible to the connection-factory
  (Setting invalid user will fail, setting valid user will pass)
* Tests whether in-flight transactions are allowed for completion after
  which actual pool reconfiguration must happen

@TODO : merge the changes with 'transparent-pool-reconfig' to test 
app-scoped-resources as part of same test
