Tests init sql feature by setting case sensitivity related session parameters as initSQL attribute. 

ALTER SESSION set NLS_SORT=BINARY will return case sensitive results from a table. This init sql query is executed before fetching the results from a table. 

The results of a same fetch will be different when a init sql query ALTER SESSION set NLS_SORT=BINARY_CI NLS_COMP=LINGUISTIC is executed. 

Based on this (for oracle 10g) this test executes to test the init sql functionality.

Oracle 10g and above is needed to execute this test case successfully.

Server would be restarted after the initsql attribute change.
