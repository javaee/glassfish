This devtest tries to test whether the appserver 
destroys the connection when it is marked as bad. A driver based pool is created and the corresponding resource is looked up from the appclient and used to test if it passes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
test1() READ_ONLY OPERATION TO DB
XA DataSource Name - "UnshareableDataSource"
ejb-descriptor - datasource is "unshareable"
Tx Attribute : NOT SUPPORTED
Pool - steady, max-pool-size : 5

Test1 will retrieve connection from pool and mark it as bad. Iterates for 5 times.
Test1 passes when the monitoring information "num-conn-destroyed-count" is 5
Cumulative "destroyed" count - UnshareableDataSource(test1 ) : 5
