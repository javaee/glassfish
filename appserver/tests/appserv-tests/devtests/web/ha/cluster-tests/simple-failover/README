To run the test

1. asadmin start-domain
2. asadmin start-cluster <cluster-name>
3. Edit HttpClient.java and Fix the path to asadmin (//TODO: Read from env)
4. mvn clean install
5. java -cp target/http-client.jar com.acme.HttpClient 18080 28080

(Where 18080 is the http listener port  and 28080 is the failover instance's http listener port)
