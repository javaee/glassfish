Simple test case with a static resource. 
It has an additional twist like this:
When you use webbundle, don't specify Web-ContextPath in the query.
The non-OSGied war has no contextpath set in manifest, so
it uses /FirstV3Test which is set in sun-web.xml.

When you install using fileinstall, the final war does have contextpath
set in manifest as well as in sun-web.xml. It shows that MANIFEST.MF takes precedence.
