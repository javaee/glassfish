        <h1>Jersey CDI Sample</h1>

        <p>This example demonstrates how to develop RESTful web service with
            JCDI managed beans and a Servlet 3.0 Web container.</p>
              
        <h2>Running the Example</h2>

        <p>This example currently works only with a standalone GlassFish 3.1.x instance. 
        The easiest way to get the application running is to use the GlassFish Update Center client, 
        install "Jersey examples and documentation" IPS module from there
        and follow instructions at the module README file in order to deploy the example.
        If you have already installed from the Update Center, the module readme file should be
        accessible <a href="../../README.html">here</a>

        <p>After you successfully deploy the application, visit the following URLs:</p>
