This test verifies the creation of a custom database when database name is specified in the glassfish-services.xml file. 

The tables listed in the initsql.sql file are created and loaded with data in the new database, as is evident from the output of the Servlet.

Please refer ../README.txt for more generic guidelines on how to run this test.
