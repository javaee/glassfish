This is a simple Paas test for Oracle/JavaDB/MySQL Database. The test creates 2 tables DEMO_TABLE and BOOKS_TABLE. DEMO_TABLE is used to update and get the last accessed time of the database. BOOKS_TABLE is used to add more books into the database table and display them as a list in the Servlet. The application also displays the version of the database that is used for the test.

Please refer ../README.txt for more generic guidelines.
