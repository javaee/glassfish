@test : test for application-scoped resources for connector-resource, connector-connection-pool

1) ant all-ext
This test case tests installed libraries support (EXTENSION_LIST specified in MANIFEST.MF) 
of a resource-adapter.

blackbox.jar is the extension which will be copied to applibs.
blackbox-tx.rar (all other generated rars) will have blackbox.jar's extension-name (blackbox)
in its EXTENSION_LIST so that it will be available at runtime.


2) ant all--libraries
This test case tests installed libraries support (specified via deploy --libraries <lib> <RAR>) 
of a resource-adapter.

blackbox.jar is the library which will be copied to applibs.
As the .rar is deployed with --libraries option, library (blackbox.jar) should be available at runtime
