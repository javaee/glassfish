Connector 1.6 spec introduces an optional behavior of 
providing applications,  access to only referred resource-adapters.
The reference may be via (resource-ref, resource-env-ref, ra-mid).

By default, GlassFish will provide access to only referred resource-adapters.
If global access is required, set the "property" named "access-all-rars" to true in "connector-service" element 
in domain.xml

It is also possible to provide access to resource-adapters not referred via the descriptors, set the "property" named
"required-resource-adapters-for-<APP_NAME>" = "rar1,rar2,rar3" in "connector-service" element in domain.xml

This test case tests all 3 modes
1) provide only referred resource-adapters
2) provide access to referred + rars list specified via "required-resource-adapters-for-<APP-NAME>" property
3) provide access to all resource-adapters
