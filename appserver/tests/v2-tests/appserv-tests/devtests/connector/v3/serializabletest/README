This test case will check whether the BootStrapContext, WorkManager, XATerminator
objects are Serializable. It is possible that any of ResourceAdapter implementation class
can have reference to these objects and serialization of such an object is possible only when
BootStrapContext, WorkManager, XATerminator implementations of app.server is serializable.
