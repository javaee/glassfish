dbreader: utility servlet that displays the count of rows in each of the database tables. It cleans out the data from the database before the next test run generates fresh data.

simpleServlet: The actual web test.
simpleJsp : Simple JSP Test. (This test is sensitive to timing issues. Incase it fails, increase the sleep time in the build.xml and it should work fine.)
