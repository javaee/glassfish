# This properties file is ready by samples.amx.SampleMain to learn
# to which server it should connect.
#
# If you aren't sure of the AMX port and/or whether TLS/SSL is enabled,
# open domain.xml and look at the <jmx-connector> element within
# the <admin-service> element:#
# <jmx-connector ... port="8686" security-enabled="false"/>
#

# the hostname or IP address of the server's host
connect.host=localhost

# the AMX RMI port, 8686 by default.  NOT the admin GUI port
connect.port=8686

# the admin user name
connect.user=admin

# the admin user password
connect.password=admin123

# set to true if using TLS for admin RMI, false otherwise
# for PE/RI, useTLS should be false by default, for EE it should be true
connect.useTLS=true

# a truststore file to store the server certificate (if useTLS is on)
connect.truststore=sample-truststore

# password to use for the truststore file
connect.truststorePassword=changeme
