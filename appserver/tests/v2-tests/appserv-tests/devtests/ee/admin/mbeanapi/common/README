This directory contains classes that can be reused for  other
tests. Examples using AMX include creating a connection to a DAS,
creating an instance, creating a cluster, deleting an instance,
deleting a cluster, starting an instance, stopping an instance,
starting a cluster and stopping a cluster, etc.

At some point a basic ant task that will set up a testing environment
of instances and clusters will be written using these classes.

To Build the common submodule run the following command in this sub
directory:
ant build

To Run the AMXConnectionVerifier test,open build.xml and 
modify the values of sysproperty as per your for the appropriate
target  do the following:
ant run-amx-connection-verifier

To Run the StandaloneInstanceManager test, open build.xml and 
modify the values of sysproperty as per your for the appropriate
target and  do the following:
ant run-standalone-instance-manager

REMEMBER TO CLEAN UP (delete) the two instances created in the above
test in order to be able to run the test again as is. If not, change
the arg element's values in the appropriate target.

More Info about classes:
1. AMXConnector is a useful utility that provides you with a
connection to DAS through the AppserverConnectionSource object (this
is the entry point for AMX). It has useful methods that give you the DomainRoot
object through which one can traverse other the AMX objects. 

2. StandaloneInstanceManager is a class that provides you with the
   ability to create, start, stop and delete a standalone instance. It
   uses AMX internally. You can use an instance of this class for
   some setup operations.

.... more to come.
