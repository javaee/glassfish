If a connection's autocommit is set to true and we attempt a select
for update sql query, Oracle throws a "ORA-01002: Fetch out of sequence"
exception. This test tries to :
1. get a connection using getNonTxConnection API and try a "select for
update" query. Since a connection obtained using getNonTxConnection
is not managed (transaction-wise), its autocommit is set to true by
default. So this fails.
2. gets a connection as above but sets its autocommit to true. The 
query will then pass.
