This devtest tries to test whether the appserver 
maintains the connection's autocommit mode.
The scenario is thus:

1. Have a pool with size 2
2. Get a connection inside a transaction (This according
 to the ConnectorXAResource architecture actually gets
 2 connections). Check that getAutoCommit is false. 
 Close connection.
3. Get 2 connections. Check that both have autocommit set
 to true, which is the JDBC default. These 2 connections
 had auto-commit set to false in step 2, but now have true.
 So in conclusion, the appserver preserves the connection's
 autocommit mode.
