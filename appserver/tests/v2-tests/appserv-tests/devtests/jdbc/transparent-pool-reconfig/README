Test for transparent dynamic reconfiguration of jdbc-connection-pool :

* Tests whether the connection-factory (DataSource) remains valid even after
  a hard reconfiguration (ie., User / Password property change for pool)
* Tests whether the changes are visible to the connection-factory
  (Setting invalid user will fail, setting valid user will pass)
* Tests whether in-flight transactions are allowed for completion after
  which actual pool reconfiguration must happen
