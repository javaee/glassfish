Description: Readme for security testsuite
- It is a bank admin application constaing 3 archives having 3+2+1=6 ear files.
- Ported from RI1.4 to S1AS8 

FIX? sun-acc.xml is added for appclient runtime on windows platform as a workaround to fix the host/port null values picked up during the appclient runtime by default. The same test worked on solaris without sun-acc.xml.
