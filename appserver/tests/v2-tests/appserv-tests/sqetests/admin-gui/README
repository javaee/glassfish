This file explains how to run QL tests for admin-gui:

1.Check out QuickLook workspace by "cvs co quicklook"
2. setenv S1AS_HOME to you install directory i.e. /export/home/s1asinstall
3. setenv APS_HOME appserv-tests workspace, i.e.
   /export/home/workspace/appserv-tests
4. You can make the required changes in config.properties file under
   appserv-tests directory, i.e. two levels above admin-gui directory.
	- The changes are like hostname, password, username, port etc.
5. Go to directory <workspace>/appserv-tests/sqetests/admin-gui. 
   Type "ant" or "ant all" on the prompt. This will execute the tests, and results are
   printed in standard out.
