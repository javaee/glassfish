    <!--
    This plugin initialize Tiles definition factory. This later can takes some
    parameters explained here after. The plugin first read parameters from
    web.xml, thenoverload them with parameters defined here. All parameters
    are optional.
    The plugin should be declared in each struts-config file.
    - definitions-config: (optional)
    Specify configuration file names. There can be several comma
    separated file names (default: ?? )
    - moduleAware: (optional - struts1.1)
    Specify if the Tiles definition factory is module aware. If true
    (default), there will be one factory for each Struts module.
    If false, there will be one common factory for all module. In this
    later case, it is still needed to declare one plugin per module.
    The factory will be initialized with parameters found in the first
    initialized plugin (generally the one associated with the default
    module).
    true : One factory per module. (default)
    false : one single shared factory for all modules
    - definitions-parser-validate: (optional)
    Specify if xml parser should validate the Tiles configuration file.
    true : validate. DTD should be specified in file header (default)
    false : no validation

    Paths found in Tiles definitions are relative to the main context.
