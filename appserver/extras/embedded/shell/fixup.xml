            Entries in zip (and JAR) files have two-second timestamp resolution.  The
            next sleep makes sure that the time stamp on the updated manifest
            file will later than the original manifest's time + two seconds;
            this make sure the zip task will actually replacde the manifest
            in the JAR file.

            Also, the manifest task seems not to update the timestamp on the
            manifest file, so we need to explicitly touch it after updating
            the manifest.
