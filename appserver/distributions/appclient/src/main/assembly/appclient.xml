    Note - the assembly plug-in is advertised as being able to set the file
    mode on files from dependencies as they are added to the assembled file.
    This feature does not work in 2.2-beta-3.  So instead we have to
    use the dependency plug-in (see the pom.xml for this module) to extract
    the relevant files and then add them as a fileSet (instead of a
    dependencySet as we'd like to do).  Because fileMode seems to work just
    fine for a fileSet.

    The following dependencySet could be uncommented (and the corresponding
    fileSet below removed) if/when the assembly
    plug-in honors the fileMode setting.  In that case, also remove the use of the
    dependency plug-in in the pom to extract the scripts from
    org.glassfish.appclient:appclient-scripts.
