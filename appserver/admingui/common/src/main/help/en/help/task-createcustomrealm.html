<h4><a id="sthref84" name="sthref84"></a><a id="sthref85" name="sthref85"></a>To Create a Custom Realm</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>In addition to the three built-in realms, you can also create custom realms that store user data in some other way, such as in a relational database. Development of a custom realm is outside the scope of this document. For more information, see <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=E26576_01&id=GSDVG00006">Chapter 5, <i>Securing Applications,</i> in <i>Oracle GlassFish Server Application Development Guide</i></a>.</p>
<p>For administration purposes, custom realms are implemented by a class (called the <code>LoginModule</code>) derived from the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) package.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Follow the procedure in <a href="task-realmnew.html">To Create a Realm</a>, typing the name of the custom realm and the name of the <code>LoginModule</code> class.</p>
<p>Use any unique name for the custom realm, for example <code>myCustomRealm</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click OK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit the domain's login configuration file, <i>domain-dir</i><code>/config/login.conf</code>, and add the fully qualified class name of the JAAS <code>LoginModule</code> at the end of the file, as follows:</p>
<pre>
<i>realmName</i> {
    <i>fully-qualified-LoginModule-classname</i> required;
};
</pre>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre>
myCustomRealm {
    com.foo.bar.security.customrealm.simpleCustomLoginModule required;
};
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>Copy the <code>LoginModule</code> class and all dependent classes into the directory <i>domain-dir</i><code>/lib/classes</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restart the server if Restart Required appears in the Administration Console.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the realm is properly loaded.</p>
<p>Check <i>domain-dir</i><code>/logs/server.log</code> to ensure that the server loaded the realm. The server should invoke the realm's <code>init</code> method.</p>
</li>
</ol>
