<h4><a id="sthref212" name="sthref212"></a>File Users</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>Use the File Users page to manage <code>file</code> realm users. Users and groups in the <code>file</code> realm are listed in the key file, whose location is specified by the <code>file</code> property.</p>
<p>A user in the <code>file</code> realm can belong to a <i>Java group</i>, a category of users classified by common traits. For example, customers of an e-commerce application might belong to the <code>CUSTOMER</code> group, but the big spenders would belong to the <code>PREFERRED</code> group. Categorizing users into groups makes it easier to control the access of large numbers of users.</p>
<p>Initially after installation of the GlassFish Server, the only user is the administrator entered during installation. By default, this user belongs to the group <code>asadmin</code>, in the realm <code>admin-realm</code>, which gives rights to modify the GlassFish Server. Any users assigned to this group will have administrator privileges, that is, they will have access to the <code>asadmin</code> tool and the Administration Console.</p>
<p>The File Users page displays a list of users for the selected realm. For each user, the following information is provided:</p>
<dl>
<dt>User ID</dt>
<dd>
<p>The user name.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Group List</dt>
<dd>
<p>The groups to which the user belongs.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The File Users table also contains the following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>New</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to create a new user.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Delete</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to delete one or more selected users.</p>
</dd>
