<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>Use the SSL page to modify the SSL settings for the JMX connector.</p>
<p>The settings on this page are meaningful only if security is enabled for the JMX connector on the Edit JMX Connector page.</p>
<p>The SSL page contains the following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Configuration Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the configuration to which the settings on this page apply. This field is read only.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SSL3</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this checkbox is selected, the SSL3 protocol is enabled for the JMX connector. This option is enabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TLS</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this checkbox is selected, the TLS protocol is enabled for the JMX connector. This option is enabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Client Authentication</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this checkbox is selected, clients must identify themselves to the server on every request. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Certificate Nickname</dt>
<dd>
<p>The nickname of the server certificate in the certificate database or the PKCS#11 token. In the certificate, the name format is <i>tokenname</i><code>:</code><i>nickname</i>. Including the <i>tokenname</i><code>:</code> part of the name in this attribute is optional.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Key Store</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the keystore file (for example, <code>keystore.jks</code>).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Trust Algorithm</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the trust management algorithm (for example, PKIX) to use for certification path validation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Max Certificate Length</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate certificates that can exist in a certification path. This field is used only if the Trust Algorithm field is set to PKIX. A value of 0 implies that the path can only contain a single certificate. A value of -1 implies that the path length is unconstrained (there is no maximum). Setting a value less than -1 causes an exception to be thrown.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Trust Store</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the truststore file (for example, <code>cacerts.jks</code>).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Cipher Suites</dt>
<dd>
<p>An area where you can add or remove cipher suites. If you do not add any cipher suites, all cipher suites will be used.</p>
</dd>
