<h4><a id="sthref63" name="sthref63"></a>To Create a Lifecycle Module</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the navigation tree, select the Lifecycle Modules node.</p>
<p>The Lifecycle Modules page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Lifecycle Modules page, click New.</p>
<p>The New Lifecycle Module page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Name field, type a name for the lifecycle module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Class Name field, type the fully qualified name of the lifecycle module's class file.</p>
<p>The class must implement the <code>com.sun.appserv.server.LifecycleListener</code> interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Classpath field, type the classpath for the lifecycle module.</p>
<p>The classpath specifies where the lifecycle module is located. The default value is <i>domain-dir</i><code>/applications</code>. If the module is already in this directory (that is, in the server classpath), this field can be left blank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Load Order field, type a value specifying the order in which this lifecycle module is to be loaded at startup.</p>
<p>Modules with smaller integer load order values are loaded sooner. The value can range from 101 to the operating system's <code>MAXINT</code>. Values from 1 to 100 are reserved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Description field, type a description of the lifecycle module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Status Enabled checkbox to enable the lifecycle module.</p>
<p>This option is enabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the On Load Failure Prevent Instance Startup checkbox to specify that the server is to be shut down if the lifecycle module fails to load.</p>
<p>This option is disabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To add target server instances and clusters on which to enable the lifecycle module, select them from the Available Targets list and use the Add button to move them to the Selected Targets list.</p>
<p>The Target option appears if clusters or standalone server instances aside from the default server instance (<code>server</code>) exist. By default, the lifecycle module is enabled on the default server instance, named <code>server</code>. Use the Add All button to deploy to all targets. Use the Remove and Remove All buttons to remove targets from the Selected Targets list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click OK.</p>
