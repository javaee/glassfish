<p>The GlassFish Server comes preconfigured with three realms: <code>file</code>, <code>certificate</code>, and <code>admin-realm</code>. It is also possible to create <code>ldap</code>, <code>JDBC</code>, <code>solaris</code>, and custom realms. Generally, you will have one realm of each type on a server, but on the GlassFish Server there are two file realms: <code>file</code> and <code>admin-realm</code>. These are two realms of the same type used for two different purposes. It is also possible to have a different certificate database for each virtual server on your system.</p>
<p>Use the Realms page to configure realms.</p>
<p>For each realm, the following information is provided.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the realm.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Class Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The class name for the realm.</p>
