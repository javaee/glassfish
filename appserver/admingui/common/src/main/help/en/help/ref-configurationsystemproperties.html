<p>The System Properties page displays a list of the Java system properties that are defined in the selected named configuration. Java system properties are passed to the Java application launcher through the <code>-D</code> option of the Java application launcher whenGlassFish Server is started</p>
<p>These properties define the default values of port settings for all GlassFish Server instances that reference the configuration.</p>
<p>For information about predefined port settings in a configuration, see <a href="ref-predefinedconfigsysproperties.html">Predefined System Properties</a>.</p>
<p>For each property, the following information is displayed:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Instance Variable Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the system property.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Default Value</dt>
<dd>
