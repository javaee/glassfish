<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>Network proxy settings determine how GlassFish Server connects to the Internet. To enable Update Tool to access network repositories through the Internet, configure your network proxy settings.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the navigation tree, select the Update Tool node.</p>
<p>The Available Add-Ons page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Available Add-Ons page, click the Configuration tab.</p>
<p>The Update Tool Configuration page is displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Update Tool Configuration page, specify how the machine where the GlassFish Server is running connects to the Internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the machine connects to the Internet directly, select the Direct Connection option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the machine connects to the Internet through a proxy, select the Through a Proxy option.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the machine where the GlassFish Server is running connects to the Internet through a proxy, provide the Proxy Host name and Proxy Port number for the proxy.</p>
<p>If the machine where the GlassFish Server is running connects directly to the Internet, omit this step.</p>
<p>A web browser might be running on the machine where the GlassFish Server is running. In this situation, you can obtain the host name and port number of the proxy from the web browser. Otherwise, ask your system administrator for this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Save.</p>
