<h5>Next Steps</h5>
<p>To uninstall any installed components, first stop the GlassFish Server domain. Then use one of these commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><i>as-install-parent</i><code>/bin/updatetool</code>, which starts the Update Tool graphical utility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>as-install-parent</i><code>/bin/pkg</code>, a command-line version of the Update Tool</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For information on using the <code>pkg</code> command, see <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=E26576_01&id=GSADG00014">Chapter 11, <i>Extending and Updating GlassFish Server,</i> in <i>Oracle GlassFish Server Administration Guide</i></a>. The Update Tool utility has its own online help.</p>
<p>Restart the server after you have finished uninstalling the components.</p>
