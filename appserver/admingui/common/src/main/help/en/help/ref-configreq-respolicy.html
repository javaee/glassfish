<p>If Authenticate Source is <code>sender</code>, then the message contains a <code>wsse:Security</code> header with a <code>wsse:UsernameToken</code> (with password). If Authenticate Source is content, then the content of the SOAP message body is signed, and the message contains a <code>wsse:Security</code> header with the message body signature represented as a <code>ds</code>:<code>Signature</code>.</p>
<p>If Authenticate Recipient is either <code>before-content</code> or <code>after-content</code>, the content of the SOAP message body is encrypted and replaced with the resulting <code>xend:EncryptedData</code>. The message contains <code>a wsse:Security</code> header that contains an <code>xenc:EncryptedKey</code>. The <code>xenc:EncryptedKey</code> contains the key used to encrypt the SOAP message body. The key is encrypted in the public key of the recipient.</p>
<p>If the Authenticate Source and Authenticate Recipient settings are left blank, then no security policy is specified, and the modules perform no security operations.</p>
<p>The following table shows message protection policy configurations and the resulting message security operations performed by the WS-Security SOAP message security providers for that configuration.</p>
