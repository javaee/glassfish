<h4><a id="sthref202" name="sthref202"></a><a id="sthref203" name="sthref203"></a>Properties Specific to the <code>CertificateRealm</code> Class</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>The <code>certificate</code> realm supports SSL authentication. This realm sets up the user identity in the GlassFish Server's security context, and populates it with user data obtained from cryptographically verified client certificates in the truststore and keystore files. Add users to these files using <code>keytool</code> or <code>certutil</code>. For more information, see <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dsc&amp;id=/app/docs/doc/821-1841#gijrp">Part&nbsp;VII, <i>Security,</i> in <i>The Java EE 6 Tutorial</i></a>.</p>
<p>With the <code>certificate</code> realm, Java containers handle authorization processing based on each user's Distinguished Name (DN) from his or her certificate. The DN is the name of the entity whose public key the certificate identifies. This name uses the X.500 standard, so it is intended to be unique across the Internet. For more information on key stores and trust stores, refer to the keytool documentation (<code><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html</a></code>).</p>
<p>The following optional property is available for the <code>certificate</code> realm.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Assign Groups</dt>
<dd>
<p>A comma-separated list of group names. All clients who present valid certificates are assigned to these groups, for example, <code>employee,manager</code>, where these are the names of user groups.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
