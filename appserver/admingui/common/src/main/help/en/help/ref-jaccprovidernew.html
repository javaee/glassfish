<h4><a id="sthref222" name="sthref222"></a>New JACC Provider</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>Use the New JACC Provider page to create a new JSR-115/196compliant Java Authorization Contract for Containers (JACC) provider that can be used by third-party authorization modules for applications running in GlassFish Server. The JACC provider is created as a <code>jacc-provider</code> element within the <code>security-service</code> element in the domain's <code>domain.xml</code> file.</p>
<p>The default GlassFish Server installation includes two JACC providers, named <code>default</code> and <code>simple</code>. Any new JACC providers you create are in addition to these two default providers. The default GlassFish Server JACC providers implement a simple, file-based authorization engine that complies with the JACC specification.</p>
<p>All GlassFish Server JACC providers must use the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) APIs. JAAS enables services to authenticate and enforce access controls upon users. JAAS implements a Java technology version of the standard Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) framework.</p>
<p>JSR 196 allows you to develop plugins at different layers. You can define plugins that change the way new authentication mechanism are configured, such as <code>AuthConfigProvider</code> and <code>AuthConfigFactory</code>. You can also define new authentication mechanisms, such as <code>ServerAuthModule</code> and <code>ClientAuthModule</code>.</p>
<p>The New JACC Provider page contains the following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Configuration Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the configuration to which the settings on this page apply. This field is read only.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the JACC provider. This name is used to reference the <code>jacc-provider</code> element in <code>domain.xml</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Policy Configuration</dt>
<dd>
<p>The fully qualified class name for the <code>javax.security.jacc.PolicyConfigurationFactory.provider</code> that implements the provider-specific <code>javax.security.jacc.PolicyConfigurationFactory</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Policy Provider</dt>
<dd>
<p>The fully qualified class name for the <code>javax.security.jacc.policy.provider</code> that implements the <code>java.security.Policy</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Additional Properties</dt>
<dd>
<p>Additional properties for the JACC provider. For a description of the additional properties that are available for JACC providers, see <a href="ref-jaccproviderprop.html">Properties Specific to JACC Providers</a>.</p>
