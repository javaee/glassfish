<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the tree component, expand the Configuration node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the Configuration node, expand the ORB node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the IIOP Listeners node.</p>
<p>The IIOP Listeners page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the table, click the name of the listener to be edited.</p>
<p>The Edit IIOP Listener page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Security Enabled checkbox is selected, click the SSL tabbed pane to modify the Secure Socket Layer settings of this IIOP listener.</p>
<p>The SSL page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the SSL page, select the SSL3 Enabled checkbox to enable SSL3.</p>
<p>This option is enabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the TLS Enabled checkbox to enable Transport Layer Security (TLS).</p>
<p>This option is enabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Client Authentication Enabled checkbox to require clients to identify themselves to the server on every request.</p>
<p>This option is disabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Certificate Nickname field, type the nickname of the server certificate in the certificate database or the PKCS#11 token.</p>
<p>In the certificate, the name format is <i>tokenname</i><code>:</code><i>nickname</i>. Including the <i>tokenname</i><code>:</code> part of the name in this attribute is optional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Key Store field, type the name of the keystore file (for example, <code>keystore.jks</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Trust Algorithm field, type the name of the trust management algorithm (for example, PKIX) to use for certification path validation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Max Certificate Length field, type the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate certificates that can exist in a certification path.</p>
<p>This field is used only if the Trust Algorithm field is set to PKIX. A value of 0 implies that the path can only contain a single certificate. A value of -1 implies that the path length is unconstrained (there is no maximum). Setting a value less than -1 causes an exception to be thrown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Trust Store field, type the name of the truststore file (for example, <code>cacerts.jks</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Cipher Suites area, specify the cipher suites to be used.</p>
<p>If you do not add any cipher suites, all cipher suites will be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click OK.</p>
</li>
