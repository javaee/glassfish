<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>A virtual server, sometimes called a virtual host, is an object that allows the same physical server to host multiple Internet domain names. All virtual servers hosted on the same physical server share the Internet Protocol (IP) address of that physical server. A virtual server associates a domain name for a server (such as <code>www.sun.com</code>) with the particular server on which the GlassFish Server is running.</p>
<p>Use the Virtual Servers page to configure virtual servers.</p>
<p>For each virtual server, the following information is provided.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the virtual server.</p>
</dd>
<dt>State</dt>
