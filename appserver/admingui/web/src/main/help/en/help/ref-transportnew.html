<h4><a id="sthref163" name="sthref163"></a>New Transport</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>Use the New Transport page to create a new transport.</p>
<p>It is not common to need another transport in addition to the default <code>tcp</code> transport.</p>
<p>The New Transport page contains the following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Configuration Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the configuration to which the settings on this page apply. This field is read only.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Transport Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>A unique name for the transport.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Classname</dt>
<dd>
<p>The class name of the transport implementation. The default value is <code>com.sun.grizzly.TCPSelectorHandler</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Selection Key Handler</dt>
<dd>
<p>The class name of the selection key handler. A selection key handler is an abstract class that manages the lifecycle of selection keys. If you do not specify a value, a default implementation is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Byte Buffer Type</dt>
<dd>
<p>The type of <code>ByteBuffer</code> to be used. Available choices are <code>HEAP</code> and <code>DIRECT</code>. The default value is <code>HEAP</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Acceptor Threads</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of processors in the machine. A value of -1 indicates that Grizzly will calculate the number of acceptor threads itself, based on the number of processors in the machine. The default value is 1.</p>
<p>To set the number of request processing threads, set the Max Thread Pool Size value of the thread pool used by a network listener that uses this transport.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Max Connections Count</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum number of pending connections on a network listener that uses this transport. The default value is 4096.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Buffer Size</dt>
<dd>
<p>The size, in bytes, of the buffer to be provided for input streams created by a network listener that uses this transport. The default value is 8192.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Idle Key Timeout</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of seconds after which an idle key will be cancelled and the channel closed. The default value is 30.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Read Timeout</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of milliseconds the GlassFish Server waits during the header and body parsing phase of a read operation. The default value is 30,000.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Selector Poll Timeout</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of milliseconds an NIO selector will block waiting for events (user requests). The default value is 1000.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Write Timeout</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of milliseconds the GlassFish Server waits before considering the remote client disconnected when writing the response. The default value is 30,000.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Display Configuration</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this option is selected, Grizzly's internal configuration is flushed to the server logs. This option may provide useful information for debugging. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Snoop</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this option is selected, the request/response information is dumped to the server log. This option may provide useful information for debugging, but will significantly reduce performance. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TCP No Delay</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this option is selected, TCP_NODELAY (also called Nagle's algorithm) is enabled. This option is enabled by default.</p>
</dd>
