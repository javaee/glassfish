<p>Keypoint operations compress the transaction log file. The keypoint interval is the number of transactions between keypoint operations on the log. Keypoint operations can reduce the size of the transaction log files. A larger number of keypoint intervals results in larger transaction log files, but fewer keypoint operations, and potentially better performance. A smaller keypoint interval (for example, 256) results in smaller log files but slightly reduced performance due to the greater frequency of keypoint operations.</p>
