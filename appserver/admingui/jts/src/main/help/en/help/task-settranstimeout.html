<h4><a id="sthref6" name="sthref6"></a>To Set a Transaction Timeout Value</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>By default, the server does not time out a transaction. That is, the server waits indefinitely for a transaction to complete. If you set a timeout value for transactions, if a transaction isn't completed within the configured time, the GlassFish Server rolls back the transaction.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the navigation tree, expand the Configuration node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the instance to configure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To configure a particular instance, select the instance's config node. For example, the default instance, <code>server</code>, select the <code>server-config</code> node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To configure the default settings for all instances, select the <code>default-config</code> node.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Transaction Service node.</p>
<p>The Transaction Service page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Transaction Timeout field, type the number of seconds before the transaction times out.</p>
<p>The default value is 0. This value disables transaction timeouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Save.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restart the GlassFish Server.</p>
