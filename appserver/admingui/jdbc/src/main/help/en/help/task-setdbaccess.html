<h4><a id="sthref2" name="sthref2"></a>To Set Up Database Access</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>To store, organize, and retrieve data, most applications use relational databases.</p>
<p>GlassFish Server includes a copy of the Java DB database and is preconfigured with the ability to access this database.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install a supported database product.</p>
<p>For a list of supported databases, see <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=E26576_01&id=GSRLN"><i>Oracle GlassFish Server Release Notes</i></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install a driver supporting the JDBC API (JDBC driver) for the database.</p>
<p>Ensure that the driver you want to use to create database connections is installed on all servers on which you want to deploy the data source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the driver's JAR file is accessible to the domain's server instance.</p>
<p>See <a href="task-integratejdbcdriver.html">To Integrate a JDBC Driver</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the database.</p>
<p>Usually, the application provider delivers scripts for creating and populating the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a connection pool for the database.</p>
<p>See <a href="task-jdbcconnectionpoolnew.html">To Create a JDBC Connection Pool</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a JDBC resource that points to the connection pool.</p>
<p>See <a href="task-jdbcresourcenew.html">To Create a JDBC Resource</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
