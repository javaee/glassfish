<h4><a id="sthref7" name="sthref7"></a><a id="sthref8" name="sthref8"></a><a id="sthref9" name="sthref9"></a>To Create a Custom JNDI Resource</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>A custom JNDI resource specifies a custom server-wide resource object factory.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the navigation tree, expand the Resources node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the Resources node, expand the JNDI node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the JNDI node, select Custom Resources.</p>
<p>The Custom Resources page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Custom Resources page, click New.</p>
<p>The New Custom Resource page opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the JNDI Name field, type a unique name.</p>
<p>This name will be registered in the JNDI naming service. The JNDI name organizes and locates components within a distributed computing environment similarly to the way that card catalogs organize and represent locations of books in a library. Consequently, the JNDI name becomes an important method of accessing the custom resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Resource Type field, do one of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From the drop-down list, select a type definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the second radio button and type a fully qualified type definition that follows the format <i>xxx</i><code>.</code><i>xxx</i>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Factory Class field, type a factory class name for the custom resource to be created.</p>
<p>The Factory Class is the user-specified name for the factory class. This class implements the <code>javax.naming.spi.ObjectFactory</code> interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Description field, Type a short description of the resource.</p>
<p>This description is a string value and can include a maximum of 250 characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Status Enabled checkbox to enable the resource.</p>
<p>By default, the resource is enabled, meaning that it is available as soon as it is created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Additional Properties section, specify additional properties for the custom resource.</p>
<p>GlassFish Server does not define any additional properties for custom resources.</p>
<p>To add a property, click the Add Property button. In the blank row that appears, type the property name in the Name field, and type the property value in the Value field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click OK.</p>
</li>
</ol>
