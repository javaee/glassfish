<h4>To Set Default Values for Configuration System Properties</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>The default values of configuration properties are defined in the configuration that the cluster or instance references.</p>

<p>This page displays the current values of the following system properties for the configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="../../../common/en/help/ref-predefinedconfigsysproperties.html">Port numbers that are predefined when the configuration was created</a></p>
</li>
