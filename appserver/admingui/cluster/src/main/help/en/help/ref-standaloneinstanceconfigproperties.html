<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>The Instance System Properties page displays a list of the Java system properties that are set for the current GlassFish Server instance. Java system properties are passed to the Java application launcher through the <code>-D</code> option of the Java application launcher whenGlassFish Server is started.</p>
<p>These properties override property definitions for port settings in the instance's configuration. Predefined port settings must be overridden if, for example, two clustered instances reside on the same host. In this situation, port settings for one instance must be overridden because both instances share the same configuration.</p>
<p>For information about predefined port settings in a configuration, see <a href="../../../common/en/help/ref-predefinedconfigsysproperties.html">Predefined Configuration System Properties</a>.</p>
<p>The Instance Name field is a read-only field that displays the name of the current instance.</p>
<p>For each property, the following information is displayed:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Instance Variable Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the system property.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Current Value</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value that is currently set for the property. This field is read only.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Override Value</dt>
<dd>
<p>The value to which the property will be set after changes are saved.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Additional Properties table also contains the following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Add Property</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to add a property. Clicking this button adds a row to the Additional Properties table.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Delete Properties</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to delete one or more selected properties. Any property that is deleted reverts to its default value or, if no default value is set, is undefined.</p>
</dd>
