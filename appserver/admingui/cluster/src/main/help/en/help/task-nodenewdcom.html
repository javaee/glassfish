<h4>To Finish the Creation of a DCOM Node</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>This task is the continuation for a DCOM node of <a href="task-createnode.html">To Create a Node</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To copy GlassFish Server software from the DAS host to the node host, enable the Install GlassFish Server option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To force the node to be created in the configuration of the domain administration server (DAS) even if validation of the node's parameters fails, enable the Force option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you require GlassFish Server to test the connection over DCOM to the node host before creating the node, perform these steps:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Enable the Validate DCOM option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Remote Test Directory field, type the name of the folder on the remote host in which GlassFish Server should create a file to test the connection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Windows Domain field, type the name of the Windows domain that contains the user that the Windows User Name option specifies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Windows User Name field, type the name of the user on this node's host that is to run the process for connecting to the host through DCOM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify how the Windows user will be authenticated when logging in to this node's host.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>Note:</b></p>
<p>GlassFish Server also supports password authentication through the <code>AS_ADMIN_WINDOWSPASSWORD</code> entry in the password file. The password file is specified in the <code>--paswordfile</code> option of the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=E26576_01&id=GSRFM00263"><code>asadmin</code>(1)</a> utility.</p>

<hr>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>To specify authentication through a password that is stored in the DAS configuration, perform these steps:</p>

<hr>
<p><b>Caution:</b></p>
<p>This password is stored in clear text in the DAS configuration. For enhanced security, use a password alias</p>

<hr>

<ol>
<li>
<p>From the Windows User Authentication drop-down list, select Password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Windows User Password field, type the password that the Windows user will use when logging in to this node's host.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>To specify authentication through a password alias, perform these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the Windows User Authentication drop-down list, select Password Alias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the Password Alias drop-down list, select an existing alias.</p>
