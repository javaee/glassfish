<li>
<p>In the navigation tree, expand the Clusters node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the expanded Clusters node, select the node for the cluster.</p>
<p>The General Information page for the cluster opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the General Information page, click the Instances tab.</p>
<p>The Clustered Server Instances page for the cluster opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the instance for which transaction recovery is required.</p>
<p>The General Information page for the instance opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the General Information page, click Recover Transactions.</p>
<p>The Recover Transactions page opens.</p>
<p>The content of the page depends on whether the instance is running.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the instance is running, the Recover Transactions page contains only the text <b>Recovery is performed by the running server itself</b> and the OK button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the instance is not running, the Recover Transactions page contains additional options.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the Destination Server drop-down list, select another instance in the same cluster that can recover the transactions on the current instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Transaction Log Directory field, type the directory in which the transaction logs are stored.</p>
<p>The default is <code>/logs/tx</code> under the domain directory. Transaction logs are kept in the <code>tx</code> subdirectory of the directory specified by Transaction Log Location setting of the Transaction Service for the cluster configuration. The default Transaction Log Location value is the directory specified by the Log Root field of the Domain Attributes page, which is located under the Advanced tab of the GlassFish Server node.</p>
