<h5>Before You Begin</h5>
<p>Ensure that following prerequisites are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All nodes where instances in the cluster reside are enabled for remote communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user of the domain administration server (DAS) can use the secure shell (SSH) to log in to the host for any node where instances in the cluster reside.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these prerequisites is not met, start the cluster by starting each instance individually from the command line by using the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=E26576_01&id=GSRFM00237"><code>start-local-instance</code>(1)</a> subcommand.</p>
