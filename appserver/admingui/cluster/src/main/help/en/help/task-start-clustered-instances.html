<p>Ensure that following prerequisites are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The user of the domain administration server (DAS) can use the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) remote protocol or secure shell (SSH) to log in to the host for any node where the instances reside.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these prerequisites is not met, start each instance individually from the command line by using the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=E26576_01&id=GSRFM00237"><code>start-local-instance</code>(1)</a> subcommand.</p>
<ol>
