<h4><a id="sthref233" name="sthref233"></a>To Test if a Node Is Reachable</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>To create or start GlassFish Server instances on a node that represents a remote host, the DAS must be able to contact the node. Before attempting to create or start instances on such a node, test that the DAS can contact the node.</p>
<p>The type of the node that you are testing must be SSH. You cannot test a node of type CONFIG because a node of type CONFIG is not enabled for remote communication.</p>
<a id="sthref234" name="sthref234"></a>
<h5>Before You Begin</h5>
<p>Ensure that the appropriate protocol for the type of the node is configured on the host that the node represents. The node is enabled for remote communication over this protocol.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the type of the node is SSH, the secure shell (SSH) protocol must be configured.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the navigation tree, select the Nodes node.</p>
<p>The <a href="ref-nodes.html">Nodes</a> page opens. This page lists all nodes in the current domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the table of nodes, follow the Ping link for the node that you are testing.</p>
<p>A message that indicates whether the DAS could contact the node is added to the Nodes page.</p>
</li>
</ol>
