<h4>Context Services<a id="sthref14" name="sthref14"></a><a id="sthref15" name="sthref15"></a></h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>Context services are used to create dynamic proxy objects that capture the context of a container and enable applications to run within that context at a later time. The context of the container is propagated to the thread executing the task.</p>
<p>Use the Context Services page to configure context service resources.</p>
<p>For each context service resource, the following information is provided.</p>
<dl>
<dt>JNDI Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>A unique name that identifies the resource.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Logical JNDI Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The logical JNDI name for the resource. See <a href="../../../common/en/help/ref-logicaljndinames.html">Logical JNDI Names</a> for more information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Enabled</dt>
<dd>
<p>(This column is displayed if only the default server instance, <code>server</code>, exists in the domain.)</p>
<p>A check mark if the resource is enabled, or an X if the resource is disabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Status</dt>
<dd>
<p>(This column is displayed if any clusters or standalone instances have been created in the domain.)</p>
<p>The number of clusters and standalone instances to which the resource is targeted and how many of these targets the resource is enabled on. For example, "Enabled on 2 of 4 Target(s)" means that the resource is targeted to four clusters and standalone instances and that it is enabled on two of these four targets.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Context Information</dt>
<dd>
<p>The container contexts propagated to threads.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>A description of the resource.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Context Services table also contains the following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>New</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to create a new resource.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Delete</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to delete one or more selected resources.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Enable</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to enable one or more selected resources.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Disable</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to disable one or more selected resources.</p>
