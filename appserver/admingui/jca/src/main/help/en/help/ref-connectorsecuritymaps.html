<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>Use the Connector Connection Pool Security Maps page to manage security maps for connector connection pools.</p>
<p>Security maps for connector connection pools enable the creation of a mapping between Java EE users and groups and EIS users and groups. A security map maps the principal received during servlet or EJB authentication to the credentials accepted by the EIS. It is possible to map multiple GlassFish Server principals to the same back-end principal.</p>
<p>A security map for a connection pool is different from a connector work security map, which maps a principal associated with an incoming work instance to a principal in a security realm of the GlassFish Server domain. See <a href="ref-worksecuritymaps.html">Work Security Maps</a> for information about connector work security maps.</p>
<p>For each security map, the following information is provided.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the security map.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Security Maps table also contains the following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>New</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to create a new security map.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Delete</dt>
<dd>
<p>Button to delete one or more selected security maps.</p>
</dd>
