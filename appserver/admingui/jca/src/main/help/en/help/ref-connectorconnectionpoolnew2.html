<h4><a id="sthref72" name="sthref72"></a>New Connector Connection Pool (Step 2 of 2)</h4>
<a name="BEGIN" id="BEGIN"></a>
<p>Use the New Connector Connection Pool (Step 2 of 2) page to create a new connector connection pool.</p>
<p>The New Connector Connection Pool (Step 2 of 2) page contains the following options.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Ping</dt>
<dd>
<p>If this option is enabled, the connection pool is pinged during creation or reconfiguration to identify and warn of any erroneous values for its attributes. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>A description of the connector connection pool.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Initial and Minimum Pool Size</dt>
<dd>
<p>The minimum number of connections in the connector connection pool. The default value is 8.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Maximum Pool Size</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum number of connections in the connector connection pool. The default value is 32.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Pool Resize Quantity</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of connections to be removed when pool idle timeout expires. The default value is 2.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Idle Timeout</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum time in seconds that a connection can remain idle in the pool. The default value is 300.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Max Wait Time</dt>
<dd>
<p>The amount of time the application requesting a connection will wait before getting a connection timeout. The default value is 60000.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Connection Validation</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the Required checkbox is selected, connections are validated before being given to the application. If a resource's validation fails, it is destroyed, and a new resource is created and returned. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>On Any Failure</dt>
<dd>
<p>If the Close All Connections checkbox is selected, GlassFish Server will close all connections in the pool and reestablish them if a single connection fails. This option is disabled by default.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Transaction Support</dt>
<dd>
<p>The chosen transaction support overrides the transaction support attribute in the resource adapter associated with this connection pool in a downward compatible way. In other words, it can support a lower transaction level than that specified in the resource adapter, or the same transaction level as that specified in resource adapter, but it cannot specify a higher level.</p>
<p>The value may be any of the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>XATransaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>The resource adapter supports resource manager local and JTA transactions by implementing the LocalTransaction and XAResource interfaces. XA transactions are controlled and coordinated by a transaction manager external to a resource manager.</p>
</dd>
<dt>LocalTransaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>The resource adapter supports local transactions by implementing the LocalTransaction interface. Local transactions are managed internal to a resource manager and involve no external transaction managers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>NoTransaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>The resource adapter does not support resource manager local or JTA transactions and does not implement the XAResource or LocalTransaction interfaces.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Additional Properties</dt>
<dd>
<p>Additional properties for the connector connection pool. Available properties depend upon the resource adapter for the connector connection pool. The name-value pairs specified in this table can be used to override the default values for the properties defined by the resource-adapter vendor.</p>
<p>If you specify a name but not a value for a property, it is removed from the table when you finish creating the connection pool. If you do not want to set a value for a property now, but you want the property to remain in the table so that the value can be set later, type a set of empty parentheses in the Value field:</p>
