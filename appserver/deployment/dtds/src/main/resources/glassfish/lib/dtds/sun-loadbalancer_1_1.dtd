      name        identifies the server instance within the cluster

      enabled     specifies whether instance is active (enabled)
                  for requests to be load balanced to it.

      disable-timeout-in-minutes  specifies the quiescing timeout interval in
                                  seconds, upon elapse of which load balancer
                                  would close all the open connections related

                                  requests would be routed to the instance.
                                  Default value would be 31 minutes (i.e. more
                                  than the default session idle timeout which is
