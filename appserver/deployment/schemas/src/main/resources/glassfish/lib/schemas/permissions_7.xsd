      This is the XML Schema for the application or module declared permissions 7.
      The declared permissions file must be named "META-INF/permissions.xml" in the
      application's ear file, or in a module's META-INF/permissions.xml if
      the module is deployed standalone.  All declared permissions must indicate
      the declared permissions schema by using the Java EE namespace:
      
      http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee
      
      and indicate the version of the schema by
      using the version element as shown below:
      
      <permissions xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee 
      	http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/permissions_7.xsd"
      version="7">
      ...
      </permisssions>
      
      The instance documents may indicate the published version of
      the schema using the xsi:schemaLocation attribute for Java EE
      namespace with the following location:
      
      http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/permissions_7.xsd

      The following conventions apply to all Java EE
      deployment descriptor elements unless indicated otherwise.
      
      - In elements that specify a pathname to a file within the
      same JAR file, relative filenames (i.e., those not
      starting with "/") are considered relative to the root of
      the JAR file's namespace.  Absolute filenames (i.e., those
      starting with "/") also specify names in the root of the
      JAR file's namespace.  In general, relative names are
      preferred.  The exception is .war files where absolute
      names are preferred for consistency with the Servlet API.

  <xsd:element name="permissions">

      <xsd:documentation>

        The permissions element is the root element in a
        declared permissions file. The declared permissions file
        declares the code based permissions granted to classes and libraries 
        packaged in the application archive, or in a module if the module is
        deployed standalone.

            <xsd:documentation>

              Each permission element declares a permission.  If no permission
              elements are declared, the application or module needs no special
              permissions, and the Java EE product may deploy it with no
              permissions beyond those necessary for the operation of the
              container.
              
              For details on the definition of the 'name' and 'actions'
              elements, refer to the Java API documentation for the class
              java.security.Permission, and its derived classes.
