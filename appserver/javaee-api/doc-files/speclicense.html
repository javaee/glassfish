<p>
Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, including your
compliance with Paragraphs 1 and 2 below, Oracle hereby grants you a
fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license (without
the right to sublicense) under Oracle's intellectual property rights
to:
<br/>
1.Review the Specification for the purposes of evaluation. This
includes: (i) developing implementations of the Specification for your
internal, non-commercial use; (ii) discussing the Specification with
any third party; and (iii) excerpting brief portions of the
Specification in oral or written communications which discuss the
Specification provided that such excerpts do not in the aggregate
constitute a significant portion of the Technology.
<br/>
2.Distribute implementations of the Specification to third parties for
their testing and evaluation use, provided that any such
implementation:
<br/>
(i) does not modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the Licensor
Name Space, or include any public or protected packages, classes, Java
interfaces, fields or methods within the Licensor Name Space other than
those required/authorized by the Specification or Specifications being
implemented;
<br/>
(ii) is clearly and prominently marked with the word "UNTESTED" or
"EARLY ACCESS" or "INCOMPATIBLE" or "UNSTABLE" or "BETA" in any list of
available builds and in proximity to every link initiating its
download, where the list or link is under Licensee's control; and
<br/>
(iii) includes the following notice:
<br/>
"This is an implementation of an early-draft specification developed
under the Java Community Process (JCP) and is made available for
testing and evaluation purposes only. The code is not compatible with
any specification of the JCP."
</p>
<p>
The grant set forth above concerning your distribution of
implementations of the specification is contingent upon your agreement
to terminate development and distribution of your "early draft"
implementation as soon as feasible following final completion of the
specification. If you fail to do so, the foregoing grant shall be
considered null and void.
</p>
<p>
No provision of this Agreement shall be understood to restrict your
ability to make and distribute to third parties applications written to
the Specification.
</p>
<p>
Other than this limited license, you acquire no right, title or
interest in or to the Specification or any other Oracle intellectual
property, and the Specification may only be used in accordance with the
license terms set forth herein. This license will expire on the earlier
of: (a) two (2) years from the date of Release listed above; (b) the
date on which the final version of the Specification is publicly
released; or (c) the date on which the Java Specification Request (JSR)
to which the Specification corresponds is withdrawn. In addition, this
license will terminate immediately without notice from Oracle if you
fail to comply with any provision of this license. Upon termination,
you must cease use of or destroy the Specification.
