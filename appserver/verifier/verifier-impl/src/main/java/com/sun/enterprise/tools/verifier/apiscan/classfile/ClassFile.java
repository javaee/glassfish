/**
 * This represents the information available in a Java .class file. This
 * interface is used by {@link ClosureCompilerImpl} for closure computation. The
 * interface only represents the information as needed by api scanning feature
 * in verifier. I expect it to evolve over time to something very similar to
 * BCEL's ClassFile. Now a note about different ways a Java class can be named
 * and in different places different names are used for the same Java class. 1)
 * In the format "p.a.b". This is what we use when declaring variables etc in a
 * Java code. I do not use this because this is not an unambiguous
 * representation of a Java class. By looking at p.a.b it is not possible to say
 * if b is an inner class in class p.a or b is an outer class in package p.a. 2)
 * In the format "p.outer$inner". It is what is used when we invoke java command
 * or Class.forName(). It is same as what is returned by
 * java.lang.Class.getName() method. It is an unambiguous representation of a
 * class name, because by looking at it, we can tell "inner" is an inner class
 * of a class "outer" which belongs to package p. By default our {@link
 * #getName()} returns in this format. 3) In the format "p/outer$inner" This is
 * the internal name of a class. It is called internal name because in byte code
 * this is what is encoded. It is again an unambiguous representation as this a
 * path expression. It is fairly simple to convert from 2 to 3 by a simple call
 * to String.replace('.','/'). Similarly to convert from 3 to 2, call
 * String.replace('/','.'); Here is a test of what you understood. What does
 * this class name "a$b.c$d.Foo$Bar$Goo" mean? "Goo" is an inner class in a
 * class "Foo$Bar" which is defined in a package "a$b.c$d".
