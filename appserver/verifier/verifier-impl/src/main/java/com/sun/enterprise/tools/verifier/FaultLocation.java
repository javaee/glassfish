/**
 * This class represents the fault location of the failed verifier assertions.
 * It can be used by IDE's to open the faulty source file in the editor.
 * 
 * The location object is initialized as part of Result initialization and so it
 * is available in every assertion. Just like every assertion has to populate
 * the result object, it will have to populate this location. 
 * For now, few assertions in package 'tests.ejb.ejb30' are modified to provide 
 * the location information.
