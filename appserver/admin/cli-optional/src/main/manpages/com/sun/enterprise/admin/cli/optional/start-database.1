start-database(1)         asadmin Utility Subcommands        start-database(1)

NAME
       start-database - starts the Java DB

SYNOPSIS
           start-database [--help] [--jvmoptions jvm-options]
           [--dbhost host] [--dbport port-no]
           [--dbhome db-file-path]

DESCRIPTION
       The start-database subcommand starts the Java DB server that is
       available for use with GlassFish Server. Java DB is based upon Apache
       Derby. Use this subcommand only for working with applications deployed
       to the server.

       When you start Java DB server by using the start-database subcommand,
       the database server is started in Network Server mode. Clients
       connecting to it must use the Java DB ClientDriver. For details on
       connecting to the database, refer to the Apache Derby documentation.

       When the database server starts, or a client connects to it
       successfully, the following files are created:

       *   The derby.log file that contains the database server process log
           along with its standard output and standard error information

       *   The database files that contain your schema (for example, database
           tables)

       These files are created at the location that is specified by the
       --dbhome option. To create the database files at a particular location,
       you must set the --dbhome option. If the --dbhome option is not
       specified, the start-database subcommand determines where to create
       these files as follows:

       *   If the current working directory contains a file that is named
           derby.log, the start-database subcommand creates the files in the
           current working directory.

       *   Otherwise, the start-database subcommand creates the files in the
           as-install/databases directory.

       The start-database subcommand starts the database process, even if it
       cannot write to the log file.

       This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --jvmoptions
           A space-separated list of command-line options that are passed to
           the Java application launcher when the database is started. By
           default, no options are passed.

           The format of an option depends on whether the option has a name
           and a value or only a name:

           *   If the option has a name and a value, the format is
               option-name=value.

           *   If the option has only a name, the format is option-name. For
               example, -Xmx512m.

       --dbhost
           The host name or IP address of the Java DB server process. The
           default is the IP address 0.0.0.0, which denotes all network
           interfaces on the host where you run the start-database subcommand.

       --dbport
           The port number where the Java DB server listens for client
           connections. This port must be available for the listen socket,
           otherwise the database server will not start. The default is 1527.

       --dbhome
           The absolute path to the directory where the database files and the
           derby.log file are created. If the --dbhome option is not
           specified, the start-database subcommand determines where to create
           these files as follows:

           *   If the current working directory contains a file that is named
               derby.log, the start-database subcommand creates the files in
               the current working directory.

           *   Otherwise, the start-database subcommand creates the files in
               the as-install/databases directory.

           To create the database files at a particular location, you must set
           the --dbhome option.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Starting Java DB
           This example starts Java DB on the host host1 and port 5001.

               asadmin> start-database --dbhost host1 --dbport 5001 --terse=true
               Starting database in the background.  Log redirected to
               /opt/SUNWappserver/databases/derby.log.

       Example 2, Starting Java DB With Options for the Java Application
       Launcher
           This example starts Java DB with the options for setting the
           minimum heap memory size to 128 megabytes and the maximum heap
           memory size to 512 megabytes.

               asadmin> start-database --jvmoptions="-Xms128m -Xmx512m" --terse=true
               Starting database in the background.
               Log redirected to /export/glassfish3/glassfish/databases/derby.log.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status applies to errors in executing the asadmin utility. For
       information on database errors, see the derby.log file. This file is
       located in the directory you specify by using the --dbhome option when
       you run the start-database subcommand. If you did not specify --dbhome,
       the value of DERBY_INSTALL defaults to as-install/javadb.

       0
           subcommand executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the subcommand
