    <description>
      The cache tag lets you cache fragments of your JSP pages.

      <required>no</required>
      <rtexprvalue>yes</rtexprvalue>
      <description>
        The cache key is suffixed to the servlet path to generate a key
        to access the cached entry. If no key is specified, a number is
        generated according to the position of the tag in the page.
      </description>

    <attribute>
      <name>timeout</name>

      <rtexprvalue>no</rtexprvalue>
      <description>
        The amount of time in seconds, after which the body of the tag
        is evaluated and the cache is refreshed. A different unit of time
        can also be specified by postfixing the timeout value with the
        desired unit: s= seconds, m= minutes, h= hours, d=days.
        The default value is "60s".
      </description>
    </attribute>
    <attribute>
      <name>nocache</name>
      <required>no</required>
      <rtexprvalue>yes</rtexprvalue>
      <description>
        If set to true, the body content is evaluated and served as if
        there was no cache tag. This offers a way to programmatically
        decide whether the cached response should be sent or whether the
        body has to be evaluated, though the response is not cached.
        The default value is "false".

    <attribute>

      <rtexprvalue>yes</rtexprvalue>
      <description>
        If set to true, the body content is evaluated irrespective of
        the timeout and the response is cached again.
        The default value is "false".
