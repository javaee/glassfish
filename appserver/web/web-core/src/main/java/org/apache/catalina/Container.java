/**
 * A <b>Container</b> is an object that can execute requests received from
 * a client, and return responses based on those requests.  A Container may
 * optionally support a pipeline of Valves that process the request in an
 * order configured at runtime, by implementing the <b>Pipeline</b> interface
 * as well.
 * <p>
 * Containers will exist at several conceptual levels within Catalina.  The
 * following examples represent common cases:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Engine</b> - Representation of the entire Catalina servlet engine,
 *     most likely containing one or more subcontainers that are either Host
 *     or Context implementations, or other custom groups.
 * <li><b>Host</b> - Representation of a virtual host containing a number
 *     of Contexts.
 * <li><b>Context</b> - Representation of a single ServletContext, which will
 *     typically contain one or more Wrappers for the supported servlets.
 * <li><b>Wrapper</b> - Representation of an individual servlet definition
 *     (which may support multiple servlet instances if the servlet itself
 *     implements SingleThreadModel).
 * </ul>
 * A given deployment of Catalina need not include Containers at all of the
 * levels described above.  For example, an administration application
 * embedded within a network device (such as a router) might only contain
 * a single Context and a few Wrappers, or even a single Wrapper if the
 * application is relatively small.  Therefore, Container implementations
 * need to be designed so that they will operate correctly in the absence
 * of parent Containers in a given deployment.
 * <p>
 * A Container may also be associated with a number of support components
 * that provide functionality which might be shared (by attaching it to a
 * parent Container) or individually customized.  The following support
 * components are currently recognized:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Loader</b> - Class loader to use for integrating new Java classes
 *     for this Container into the JVM in which Catalina is running.
 * <li><b>Logger</b> - Implementation of the <code>log()</code> method
 *     signatures of the <code>ServletContext</code> interface.
 * <li><b>Manager</b> - Manager for the pool of Sessions associated with
 *     this Container.
 * <li><b>Realm</b> - Read-only interface to a security domain, for
 *     authenticating user identities and their corresponding roles.
 * <li><b>Resources</b> - JNDI directory context enabling access to static
 *     resources, enabling custom linkages to existing server components when
 *     Catalina is embedded in a larger server.
 * </ul>
