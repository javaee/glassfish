/**
 * A <b>Connector</b> is a component responsible receiving requests from,
 * and returning responses to, a client application.  A Connector performs
 * the following general logic:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Receive a request from the client application.
 * <li>Create (or allocate from a pool) appropriate Request and Response
 *     instances, and populate their properties based on the contents of
 *     the received request, as described below.
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>For all Requests, the <code>connector</code>,
 *         <code>protocol</code>, <code>remoteAddr</code>,
 *         <code>response</code>, <code>scheme</code>,
 *         <code>secure</code>, <code>serverName</code>,
 *         <code>serverPort</code> and <code>stream</code>
 *         properties <b>MUST</b> be set. The <code>contentLength</code>
 *         and <code>contentType</code> properties are also generally set.
 *     <li>For HttpRequests, the <code>method</code>, <code>queryString</code>,
 *         <code>requestedSessionCookie</code>,
 *         <code>requestedSessionId</code>, <code>requestedSessionURL</code>,
 *         <code>requestURI</code>, and <code>secure</code> properties
 *         <b>MUST</b> be set.  In addition, the various <code>addXxx</code>
 *         methods must be called to record the presence of cookies, headers,
 *         and locales in the original request.
 *     <li>For all Responses, the <code>connector</code>, <code>request</code>,
 *         and <code>stream</code> properties <b>MUST</b> be set.
 *     <li>No additional headers must be set by the Connector for
 *         HttpResponses.
 *     </ul>
 * <li>Identify an appropriate Container to use for processing this request.
 *     For a stand alone Catalina installation, this will probably be a
 *     (singleton) Engine implementation.  For a Connector attaching Catalina
 *     to a web server such as Apache, this step could take advantage of
 *     parsing already performed within the web server to identify the
 *     Context, and perhaps even the Wrapper, to utilize in satisfying this
 *     Request.
 * <li>Call the <code>invoke()</code> method of the selected Container,
 *     passing the initialized Request and Response instances as arguments.
 * <li>Return any response created by the Container to the client, or
 *     return an appropriate error message if an exception of any type
 *     was thrown.
 * <li>If utilizing a pool of Request and Response objects, recycle the pair
 *     of instances that was just used.
 * </ul>
 * It is expected that the implementation details of various Connectors will
 * vary widely, so the logic above should considered typical rather than
 * normative.
