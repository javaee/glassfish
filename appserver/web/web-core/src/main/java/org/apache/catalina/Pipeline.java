/**
 * <p>Interface describing a collection of Valves that should be executed
 * in sequence when the <code>invoke()</code> method is invoked.  It is
 * required that a Valve somewhere in the pipeline (usually the last one)
 * must process the request and create the corresponding response, rather
 * than trying to pass the request on.</p>
 *
 * <p>There is generally a single Pipeline instance associated with each
 * Container.  The container's normal request processing functionality is
 * generally encapsulated in a container-specific Valve, which should always
 * be executed at the end of a pipeline.  To facilitate this, the
 * <code>setBasic()</code> method is provided to set the Valve instance that
 * will always be executed last.  Other Valves will be executed in the order
 * that they were added, before the basic Valve is executed.</p>
