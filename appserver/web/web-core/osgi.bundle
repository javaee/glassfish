# Normally Import-Package is not required, as the default value of *
# is enough to find all static dependencies. But, when a module is
# doing Class.forName, there is no foolproof way to find out the
# desired package name, hence we need to add those packages explicitly.
# In this case, org.apache.jk.server is one such package. It is used
# when mod_jk configuration is used. Since, it is not always needed,
# the import has been marked as optional. By Sahoo.
