create.http.listener=The create-http-listener command creates an HTTP listener.
create.http.listener.listeneraddress=The IP address or the hostname (resolvable by DNS).
create.http.listener.listenerport=The port number to create the listen socket on. Legal values are 1\u201365535. On UNIX, creating sockets that listen on ports 1\u20131024 requires superuser privileges. Configuring an SSL listen socket to listen on port 443 is recommended.
create.http.listener.defaultvs=The ID attribute of the default virtual server for this listener.
create.http.listener.servername=Tells the server what to put in the host name section of any URLs it sends to the client. This affects URLs the server automatically generates; it doesn't affect the URLs for directories and files stored in the server. This name should be the alias name if your server uses an alias. If a colon and port number are appended, that port will be used in URLs that the server sends to the client.
create.http.listener.xpowered=If set to true, adds the X-Powered-By: Servlet/2.4 and X-Powered-By: JSP/2.0 headers to the appropriate responses. The Servlet 2.4 specification defines the X-Powered-By: Servlet/2.4 header, which containers may add to servlet-generated responses. Similarly, the JSP 2.0 specification defines the X-Powered-By: JSP/2.0 header, which containers may add to responses that use JSP technology. The goal of these headers is to aid in gathering statistical data about the use of Servlet and JSP technology.
create.http.listener.acceptorthreads=The number of acceptor threads for the listen socket. The recommended value is the number of processors in the machine. The default value is 1.
create.http.listener.securityenabled=If set to true, the HTTP listener runs SSL. You can turn SSL2 or SSL3 ON or OFF and set ciphers using an SSL element. The security setting globally enables or disables SSL by making certificates available to the server instance. The default value is false.
create.http.listener.listener_id=The listener ID of the HTTP listener.
create.http.listener.default-virtual-server=The ID attribute of the default virtual server for this listener.

create.virtual.server=The create-virtual-server command creates the named virtual server. Virtualization in the Application Server allows multiple URL domains to be served by a single HTTP server process that is listening on multiple host addresses. If the application is available at two virtual servers, they still share the same physical resource pools.
create.virtual.server.hosts=A comma-separated (,) list of values allowed in the host request header to select the current virtual server. Each virtual server that is configured to the same connection group must have a unique host for that group.
create.virtual.server.httplisteners=A comma-separated (,) list of HTTP listener IDs. Required only for a virtual server that is not the default virtual server.
create.virtual.server.defaultwebmodule=The standalone web module associated with this virtual server by default.
create.virtual.server.state=Determines whether a virtual server is active (on) or inactive (off or disabled). Default is active (on). When inactive, the virtual server does not service requests.
create.virtual.server.logfile=Name of the file where log entries for this virtual server are to be written. By default, this is the server log.
create.virtual.server.property=Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the virtual server.
create.virtual.server.virtual_server_id=Identifies the unique ID for the virtual server to be created. This ID cannot begin with a number.

delete.http.listener=The delete-http-listener command removes the specified HTTP listener.
delete.http.listener.listener_id=The listener ID of the HTTP listener.
delete.http.listener.secure=If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to communicate with the domain administration server.

delete.virtual.server=The delete-virtual-server command removes the virtual server with the specified virtual server ID.
delete.virtual.server.virtual_server_id=The unique identifier for the virtual server to be deleted.



list.http.listeners=The list-http-listeners command lists the existing HTTP listeners.

list.virtual.servers=The list-virtual-servers command lists the existing virtual servers.
