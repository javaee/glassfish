NAME
     freeze-transaction-service - freezes the transaction subsys-
     tem

SYNOPSIS
     freeze-transaction-service
     [--help]
      [ --target  target]

DESCRIPTION
     The freeze-transaction-service subcommand freezes the  tran-
     saction  subsystem,  suspending  all in-flight transactions.
     Invoke this command before rolling back any in-flight  tran-
     sactions.  Invoking  this  subcommand  on  an already frozen
     transaction subsystem has no effect. This subcommand is sup-
     ported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         The target server instance on which  the  subcommand  is
         run.

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.
