NAME
     freeze-transaction-service - freezes the transaction subsys-
     tem

SYNOPSIS
     freeze-transaction-service [--help] [--target target]

DESCRIPTION
     The freeze-transaction-service subcommand freezes the  tran-
     saction  subsystem,  preventing the transaction manager from
     starting, completing, or changing the state of all in-flight
     transactions.  Invoke  this  command before rolling back any
     in-flight  transactions.  Invoking  this  subcommand  on  an
     already frozen transaction subsystem has no effect. Restart-
     ing the server unfreezes  the  transaction  subsystem.  This
     subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
