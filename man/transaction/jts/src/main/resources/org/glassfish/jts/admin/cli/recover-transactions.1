NAME
     recover transactions - manually  recovers  pending  transac-
     tions

SYNOPSIS
     recover-transactions
     [--help]
      [ --txlogdir  transaction_log_dir ] [--destination destination_server_name ]
      server_name

DESCRIPTION
     The recover-transactions subcommand manually recovers  pend-
     ing  transactions.  This  subcommand  is used in remote mode
     only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --transactionlogdir
         The location of the transaction logs  for  a  particular
         server.  When  a  server fails it writes the location in
         its transaction log.

         If the failed server's transaction logs  are  copied  to
         some  other  location to make it available to the surro-
         gate recovery server, use this option to specify the new
         location of the transaction logs. If the failed server's
         transaction service tx-log-dir property is  modified  to
         reflect   a  new  location,  then  this  option  is  not
         required.

     --destination

         The name of the destination server on which the  pending
         transactions need to be recovered.

OPERANDS
     server_name
         The name of the server that failed. The in-flight  tran-
         sactions  on  this  server will be recovered. For stand-
         alone servers the value of  this  operand  is  typically
         server.
