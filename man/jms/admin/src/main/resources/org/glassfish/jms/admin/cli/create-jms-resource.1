SYNOPSIS
     create-jms-resource [--help]

DESCRIPTION
     The create-jms-resource subcommand creates  a  Java  Message
     Service  (JMS) connection factory resource or a JMS destina-
     tion resource. This subcommand is supported in  remote  mode
     only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --restype

         The JMS resource type,  which  can  be  javax.jms.Topic,
         javax.jms.Queue,            javax.jms.ConnectionFactory,
         javax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory,                     or
         javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory.

     --enabled
         If set to true (the default), the resource is enabled at
         runtime.

     --description

         Text providing details about the JMS resource.

     --property
         Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring  the

         JMS resource.

         You can specify the following properties for  a  connec-
         tion factory resource:

         ClientId

             A client ID for a connection factory  that  will  be
             used by a durable subscriber.

         AddressList
             A comma-separated list of  message  queue  addresses
             that  specify  the host names (and, optionally, port
             numbers) of a message broker instance  or  instances
             with  which  your  application will communicate. For
             example, the value could  be  earth  or  earth:7677.
             Specify  the  port  number  if the message broker is
             running on a port other than the default (7676). The
             default  value  is an address list composed from the
             JMS hosts defined in the server's JMS service confi-
             guration.  The  default  value  is localhost and the
             default port number is 7676. The client will attempt
             a  connection  to a broker on port 7676 of the local
             host.

         UserName

             The  user  name  for  the  connection  factory.  The
             default value is guest.

         Password
             The password for the connection factory. The default
             value is guest.

         ReconnectEnabled

             A value of true indicates that  the  client  runtime
             attempts  to  reconnect  to a message server (or the
             list of addresses in the AddressList) when a connec-
             tion is lost. The default value is false.

         ReconnectAttempts
             The number of attempts to connect (or reconnect) for
             each  address  in  the AddressList before the client
             runtime tries the next address in the list. A  value
             of   -1  indicates  that  the  number  of  reconnect
             attempts is unlimited (the client  runtime  attempts

             to  connect to the first address until it succeeds).
             The default value is 6.

         ReconnectInterval

             The  interval  in  milliseconds  between   reconnect
             attempts.  This  applies to attempts on each address
             in the AddressList and for successive  addresses  in
             the  list.  If the interval is too short, the broker
             does not have time to recover. If it  is  too  long,
             the reconnect might represent an unacceptable delay.
             The default value is 30,000 milliseconds.

         AddressListBehavior
             Specifies whether connection  attempts  are  in  the
             order  of addresses in the AddressList (PRIORITY) or
             in a random order (RANDOM). PRIORITY means that  the
             reconnect  will  always  try to connect to the first
             server address  in  the  AddressList  and  will  use
             another  one  only if the first broker is not avail-
             able. If you have many clients attempting a  connec-
             tion using the same connection factory, specify RAN-
             DOM to prevent them from all being connected to  the
             same  address. The default value is the AddressList-
             Behavior value of the server's  JMS  service  confi-
             guration.

         AddressListIterations

             The number of  times  the  client  runtime  iterates
             through  the  AddressList  in an effort to establish
             (or re-establish) a connection). A value of -1 indi-
             cates  that the number of attempts is unlimited. The
             default value is -1.

         You can specify the following properties for a  destina-
         tion resource:

         Name
             The name of the physical destination  to  which  the
             resource  will  refer.  The  physical destination is
             created automatically when you  run  an  application
             that  uses  the  destination  resource. You can also
             create  a  physical  destination  with  the  create-
             jmsdest  subcommand. If you do not specify this pro-
             perty, the JMS service creates a  physical  destina-
             tion  with the same name as the destination resource
             (replacing any forward slash in the JNDI  name  with
             an underscore).

         Description

             A description of the physical destination.

OPERANDS
     jndi_name
         The JNDI name of the JMS resource to be created.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Creating a JMS  connection  factory  resource  for
     durable subscriptions

     The  following  subcommand  creates  a  connection   factory
     resource of type javax.jms.ConnectionFactory whose JNDI name
     is jms/DurableConnectionFactory. The ClientId property  sets
     a client ID on the connection factory so that it can be used
     for durable subscriptions. The JNDI name for a JMS  resource
     customarily includes the jms/ naming subcontext.

       asadmin> create-jms-resource --restype javax.jms.ConnectionFactory
       --description "connection factory for durable subscriptions"
       --property ClientId=MyID jms/DurableConnectionFactory
       Command create-jms-resource executed successfully.

     Example 2 Creating a JMS destination resource

     The following  subcommand  creates  a  destination  resource
     whose  JNDI name is jms/MyQueue. The Name property specifies
     the physical destination to which the resource refers.

       asadmin> create-jms-resource --restype javax.jms.Queue
       --property Name=PhysicalQueue jms/MyQueue
       Command create-jms-resource executed successfully.
