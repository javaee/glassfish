NAME
     jms-ping - checks if the JMS service is up and running

SYNOPSIS
     jms-ping [--help]
     [-- target target]

DESCRIPTION
     The jms-ping subcommand checks if the Java  Message  Service
     (JMS)  service  (also  known  as the JMS provider) is up and
     running. When you start the GlassFishTM Server, the JMS ser-
     vice starts by default.

     The jms-ping subcommand pings  only  the  default  JMS  host
     within the JMS service. It displays an error message when it
     is unable to ping a built-in JMS service.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Specifies the target for which the operation  is  to  be
         performed. Valid values are as follows:

         server

             Pings  the  JMS  service  for  the  default   server
             instance. This is the default value

         configuration-name
             Pings the JMS service for  all  clusters  using  the
             specified configuration.
