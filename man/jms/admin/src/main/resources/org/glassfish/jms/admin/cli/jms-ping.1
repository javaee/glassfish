NAME
     jms-ping - checks if the JMS service is up and running

SYNOPSIS
     jms-ping [--help]
     [target]

DESCRIPTION
     The jms-ping subcommand checks if the Java  Message  Service
     (JMS)  service  (also  known  as the JMS provider) is up and
     running. When you start the GlassFishTM Server, the JMS ser-
     vice starts by default.

     The jms-ping subcommand pings  only  the  default  JMS  host
     within the JMS service. It displays an error message when it
     is unable to ping a built-in JMS service.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

OPERANDS
     target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.
