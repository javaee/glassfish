asadmin Utility Subcommands                   get-client-stubs(1)

NAME
     get-client-stubs - retrieves the client stub JAR file.

SYNOPSIS
     get-client-stubs
     [--help]
      --appname  application_name[--target target] [local_directory_path]

DESCRIPTION
     The get-client-stubs  subcommand  copies  the  required  JAR
     files  for an AppClient stand-alone module or each AppClient
     module in an application from  the  server  machine  to  the
     local  directory.  Each  client's stub JAR file is retrieved
     separately, along with any required supporting JAR  files  .
     The  client JAR file name is of the form app-nameClient.jar.
     Before executing the get-client-stubs subcommand,  you  must
     deploy  the  application or module. The client stub JAR file
     is useful for running the application  using  the  appclient
     utility. This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --appname
         The  name  of  the  application  or  stand-alone  client
         module.

     --target

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     local_directory_path
         The path to the local directory where  the  client  stub
         JAR  file  should  be stored. The default is the current
         directory.
