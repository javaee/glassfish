         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --poolname
         The name of  the  connection  pool.  When  two  or  more

         ment, they use the same pool connections at runtime.

         at runtime. The default value is true.

     --objecttype

         system-admin

             A system resource only for the DAS.

         system-instance
             A system resource for all server instances only.

         user

             A user resource.

     --description
         Text providing details about the connector resource.

     --property

         Optional attribute name value pairs for configuring  the
         resource.

     --target
         This option specifies the ending location of the connec-
         tor resources. Valid targets are:

         Note -

           The resource is always created for  the  domain  as  a
           whole, but the <resource-ref> element for the resource
           is only created for the specified --target. This means
           that  although  the  resource is defined at the domain
           level, it is only active at the specified --target.

         server

             Creates the connector resource in the default server
             instance. This is the default value.

         domain
             Creates the connector resource in the domain.

         cluster_name

             Creates  the  connector  resource  in  every  server
             instance in the cluster.
