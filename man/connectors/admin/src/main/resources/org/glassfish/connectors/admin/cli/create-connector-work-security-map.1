NAME

     map for the specified resource adapter.

SYNOPSIS
     create-connector-work-security-map [--help]
     --raname resource-adapter-name
     {--principalsmap eis-principal1=principal_name1[, eis-principal2=principal_name2]* |
     --groupsmap eis-group1=server-group1[, eis-group2=server-group2]*}
     [--description text]

DESCRIPTION
     You can use this subcommand to map the  caller  identity  of
     the  work submitted by the resource adapter EIS principal or
     EIS user group to a suitable principal or user group in  the
     application  server  security domain. One or more work secu-
     rity maps may be associated with  a  resource  adapter.  The
     connector  work  security map configuration supports the use
     of the wild card asterisk (*) to indicate all users  or  all
     user groups.

     The enterprise information system (EIS) is any  system  that
     holds  the data of an organization. It can be a mainframe, a
     messaging system, a database system, or an application.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
