     belonging to the specified connector connection pool

SYNOPSIS

     connector_connection_pool_name

DESCRIPTION
     Use this subcommand to list the security maps  belonging  to
     the specified connector connection pool.

     For this subcommand to succeed, you must have first  created
     a  connector  connection  pool  using  the create-connector-
     connection-pool subcommand.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --securitymap
         Specifies the name of the security map contained  within
         the  connector  connection  pool from which the identity
         and principals should be listed. With  this  option,  --
         verbose is redundant.

     --verbose

         If set to true, returns a list including  the  identity,
         principals, and security name. The default is false.

OPERANDS
