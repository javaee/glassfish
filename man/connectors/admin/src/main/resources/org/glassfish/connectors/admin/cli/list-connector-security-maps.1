DESCRIPTION
     The list-connector-security-maps subcommand lists the  secu-
     rity  maps  belonging  to the specified connector connection
     pool.

     For this subcommand to succeed, you must have first  created
     a  connector  connection  pool  using  the create-connector-
     connection-pool subcommand.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

     --securitymap
         Specifies the name of the security map contained  within
         the  connector  connection  pool from which the identity
         and principals should be listed. With  this  option,  --
         verbose is redundant.

         principals, and security name. The default is false.
