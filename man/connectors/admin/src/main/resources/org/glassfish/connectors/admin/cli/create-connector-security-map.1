NAME
     create-connector-security-map - creates a security  map  for
     the specified connector connection pool

SYNOPSIS
     create-connector-security-map [--help]
     --poolname connector_connection_pool_name
     --principals principal_name1[, principal_name2]* |
     --usergroups user_group1[, user_group2*]
     --mappedusername  username
     security_map_name

DESCRIPTION
     Use this subcommand to create a security map for the  speci-
     fied  connector  connection pool. If the security map is not
     present, a new one is created. Also, use this subcommand  to
     map  the  caller  identity  of the application (principal or
     user group) to a suitable EIS principal in container-managed
     transaction-based scenarios. One or more named security maps
     may be associated with a connector connection pool. The con-
     nector  security  map  configuration supports the use of the
     wild card asterisk (*) to indicate all  users  or  all  user
     groups.

     For this subcommand to succeed, you must have first  created
     a  connector  connection  pool  using  the create-connector-
     connection-pool subcommand.

     The enterprise information system (EIS) is any  system  that
     holds  the data of an organization. It can be a mainframe, a
     messaging system, a database system, or an application.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
