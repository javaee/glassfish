NAME
     create-connector-security-map - creates a security  map  for
     the specified connector connection pool

SYNOPSIS
     create-connector-security-map [--help]
     --poolname connector_connection_pool_name
     --principals principal-name1[, principal-name2]* |
     --usergroups user-group1[, user-group2*]
     --mappedusername  user-name
     mapname

DESCRIPTION
     The create-connector-security-map subcommand creates a secu-
     rity map for the specified connector connection pool. If the
     security map is not present, a new one is created. This sub-
     command  can also map the caller identity of the application
     (principal or user group) to a suitable enterprise  informa-
     tion    system    (EIS)   principal   in   container-managed
     transaction-based scenarios. The  EIS  is  any  system  that
     holds  the data of an organization. It can be a mainframe, a
     messaging system, a database system, or an application.  One
     or more named security maps can be associated with a connec-
     tor connection pool. The connector security  map  configura-
     tion supports the use of the wild card asterisk (*) to indi-
     cate all users or all user groups.

     To   specify   the   EIS   password,   you   can   add   the
     AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD  entry  to  the  password file, then
     specify the file by using the --passwordfile asadmin utility
     option.

     For this subcommand to succeed, you must have first  created
     a  connector  connection  pool  using  the create-connector-
     connection-pool subcommand.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --poolname
         Specifies the name of the connector connection  pool  to
         which the security map belongs.

     --principals

         Specifies a list of backend EIS  principals.  More  than

     --usergroups

         one user groups can be specified using a comma separated
         list.   Use  either  the  --principals  or  --usergroups

     --mappedusername

         Specifies the EIS username.

OPERANDS
