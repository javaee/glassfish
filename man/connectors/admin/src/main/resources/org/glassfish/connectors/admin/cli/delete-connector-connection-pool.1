NAME
     delete-connector-connection-pool  -  removes  the  specified
     connector connection pool

SYNOPSIS
     delete-connector-connection-pool [--help]
     [--cascade={false|true}] [--target target]
     connector_connection_pool_name

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-connector-connection-pool subcommand removes  the
     connector   connection  pool  specified  using  the  operand
     connector_connection_pool_name.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --cascade
         When set to true, it  deletes  all  connector  resources
         associated  with  the  pool  apart from the pool itself.
         When set to false, the deletion of  pool  fails  if  any
         resources  are  associated  with  the pool. The resource
         must be deleted explicitly or the option must be set  to
         true. The default setting is false.

     --target

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     connector_connection_pool_name
         The name of the connection pool to be removed.
