DESCRIPTION
     The  create-custom-resource  subcommand  creates  a   custom
     resource.  A  custom resource specifies a custom server-wide
     resource    object    factory    that     implements     the
     javax.naming.spi.ObjectFactory interface.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

         will be available. Valid values are:

         Note -

           The resource is always created for  the  domain  as  a
           whole, but the <resource-ref> element for the resource
           is only created for the specified --target. This means
           that  although  the  resource is defined at the domain
           level, it is only active at the specified --target.

         server           The resource will be available on   the
                          default server instance and all domains
                          hosted on the  instance.  This  is  the
                          default value.

         domain           The resource will be available  on  the
                          specified domain only.

         cluster_name     The resource will be available on every
                          server instance in the cluster.
