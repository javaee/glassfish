DESCRIPTION
     The delete-connector-security-map subcommand deletes a secu-
     rity map for the specified connector connection pool.

     For this subcommand to succeed, you must have first  created
     a  connector  connection  pool  using  the create-connector-
     connection-pool subcommand.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --poolname
         Specifies the name of the connector connection  pool  to
         which the security map that is to be deleted belongs.

     --target

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.
