     the specified connector connection pool

SYNOPSIS
     delete-connector-security-map [--help]

     [--target target]
     security_map_name

DESCRIPTION
     Use this subcommand to delete a security map for the  speci-
     fied connector connection pool.

     For this subcommand to succeed, you must have first  created
     a  connector  connection  pool  using  the create-connector-
     connection-pool subcommand.

     The enterprise information system (EIS) is any  system  that
     holds  the  information.  It can be a mainframe, a messaging
     system, a database system, or an application.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS

     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --poolname
         Specifies the name of the connector connection  pool  to
         which the security map that is to be deleted belongs.

     --target

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     security_map_name
         Name of the security map to be deleted.
