NAME
     create-resource-adapter-config - creates  the  configuration
     information for the connector module

SYNOPSIS
     create-resource-adapter-config [--help] [--threadpoolid threadpool]
     [--objecttype object-type] [--property (property-name=value)[:name=value]*]
     raname

DESCRIPTION
     The create-resource-adapter-config subcommand creates confi-
     guration  information for the connector module. This subcom-
     mand can be run before deploying a resource adapter, so that
     the  configuration  information  is available at the time of
     deployment. The resource adapter configuration can  also  be
     created  after  the  resource  adapter  is deployed. In this
     case, the resource adapter is restarted with the new  confi-
     guration.  You  must  first  create a thread pool, using the
     create-threadpool subcommand, and then identify that  thread
     pool value as the ID in the --threadpoolid option.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

  Application Scoped Resources
     The create-resource-adapter-config subcommand can be  scoped
     such  that  the  resource configuration is available only to
     the application for which it is defined. Configurations that
     are scoped in this way cannot be referred to or looked up by
     other applications. If an application tries  to  look  up  a
     scoped  resource  that  does  not  belong to the application
     (defined in  another  application)  or  module  (defined  in
     another module), a naming exception is thrown.

     To scope a resource to a specific  application,  define  the
     resource  in  a  glassfish-resources.xml  file  in  the  RAR
     archive  for  the  corresponding   connector   module.   The
     glassfish-resources.xml should be a valid XML file that con-
     forms to the glassfish-resources.dtd.

     The scoping can be  applied  at  the  application  level  or
     module level.

         o    To scope a resource at the application level, place
              the glassfish-resources.xml containing the resource
              definition in the top-level META-INF  directory  of
              the  RAR archive (META-INF/glassfish-resources.xml)
              . The resource can be  referenced  through  lookups
              with  the  java:app  prefix.  The  resource will be

              available only to the application (and its modules)
              for which it is defined.

         o    To scope a resource at the module level, place  the
              glassfish-resources.xml   containing  the  resource
              definition in the RAR bundled at the module  level.
              The resource can be referenced through lookups with
              the java:module prefix. The resource will be avail-
              able only to the module for which it is defined.

     The jndi-name for  application-scoped-resources  or  module-
     scoped-resources    are    specified    using   the   format
     java:app/jdbc/myDataSource                                or
     java:module/jdbc/myModuleLevelDataSource.  This naming scope
     is   defined   in    the    Java    EE    6    Specification
     (http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/).

     Note -

       Note the following restrictions:

           o    If the prefix java:app/ or  java:module/  is  not
                specified  in  the resource name, the prefix will
                be  applied  appropriately   and   persisted   in
                domain.xml.

           o    The  java:global  prefix  is  not  supported   in
                GlassFish Server 3.0.1.

           o    The create-resource-adapter-config  configuration
                can   only   be   defined   in   the   glassfish-
                resources.xml  for  a   corresponding   connector
                module  (standalone  RAR).  In the case of an EAR
                archive, the create-resource-adapter-config  con-
                figuration  can  only  be defined in a glassfish-
                resources.xml in a RAR that  is  bundled  in  the
                EAR. It is not permissible to define the resource
                in a RAR that is not part of the EAR  with  which
                the resource will be used.

     --threadpoolid

         The thread pool ID from which the work manager gets  the
         thread. This option takes only one thread pool ID.

     --objecttype
         The default is user.

     --property

         Keyword-value pairs that specify  additional  configura-
         tion  properties  of the resource adapter Java bean. The
         keyword-value pairs are separated by a  colon  (:).  The
         properties  are the names of setter methods of the class
         that is referenced by the resourceadapter-class  element
         in the ra.xml file.

OPERANDS
     raname
         Indicates the connector module name. It is the value  of
         the resource-adapter-name in the domain.xml file.
