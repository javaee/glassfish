NAME
     create-resource-adapter-config - creates  the  configuration
     information for the connector module

SYNOPSIS
     create-resource-adapter-config [--help] [--threadpoolid threadpool] [--objecttype user]
     [--property (property-name=value)[:name=value]*]
      raname

DESCRIPTION
     The create-resource-adapter-config subcommand creates confi-
     guration  information for the connector module. This subcom-
     mand can be run before deploying a resource adapter, so that
     the  configuration  information  is available at the time of
     deployment. The resource adapter configuration can  also  be
     created  after  the  resource  adapter  is deployed. In this
     case, the resource adapter is restarted with the new  confi-
     guration.  You  must  first  create a thread pool, using the
     create-threadpool subcommand, and then identify that  thread
     pool value as the ID in the --threadpoolid option.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

     --threadpoolid

     --objecttype

     --property

         This option specifies the  configuration  properties  of
         the  resource  adapter  java bean. The properties can be
         specified as name value pairs separated by a colon  (:).
         Names  of  setter methods of the class referenced by the
         resourceadapter-class element in the ra.xml file.
