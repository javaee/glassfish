NAME
     create-resource-adapter-config - creates  the  configuration
     information for the connector module

SYNOPSIS
     create-resource-adapter-config [--help] [--threadpoolid threadpool]
     [--objecttype object-type] [--property (property-name=value)[:name=value]*]
     raname

DESCRIPTION
     The create-resource-adapter-config subcommand creates confi-
     guration  information for the connector module. This subcom-
     mand can be run before deploying a resource adapter, so that
     the  configuration  information  is available at the time of
     deployment. The resource adapter configuration can  also  be
     created  after  the  resource  adapter  is deployed. In this
     case, the resource adapter is restarted with the new  confi-
     guration.  You  must  first  create a thread pool, using the
     create-threadpool subcommand, and then identify that  thread
     pool value as the ID in the --threadpoolid option.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help , -?
          Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
          This option has been deprecated.

     --threadpoolid
          The thread pool ID from which the work manager gets the
          thread. This option takes only one thread pool ID.

     --objecttype
          The default is user.

     --property
          Keyword-value pairs that specify additional  configura-
          tion  properties of the resource adapter Java bean. The
          keyword-value pairs are separated by a colon  (:).  The
          properties are the names of setter methods of the class
          that is referenced by the resourceadapter-class element
          in the ra.xml file.

OPERANDS
     raname
          Indicates the connector module name. It is the value of
          the resource-adapter-name in the domain.xml file.
