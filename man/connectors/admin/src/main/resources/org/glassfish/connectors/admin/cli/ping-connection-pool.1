NAME
     ping-connection-pool - tests if a connection pool is usable

SYNOPSIS
     ping-connection-pool [--help] pool_name
     [--appname application [--modulename module]

DESCRIPTION
     The ping-connection-pool subcommand  tests  if  an  existing
     JDBC  or  connector connection pool is usable . For example,
     if you create a new JDBC connection pool for an  application
     that  is  expected  to  be  deployed later, the JDBC pool is
     tested with this subcommand before  deploying  the  applica-
     tion.

     Before testing availability of a connection pool,  you  must
     create  the  connection  pool with authentication and ensure
     that the server or database is started.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

  APPLICATION SCOPED RESOURCES
     The ping-connection-pool  subcommand  can  target  resources
     that  are  scoped  to  a  specific application or module, as
     defined in the  glassfish-resources.xml  for  the  GlassFish
     domain.

     o To reference  the  jndi-name  for  an  application  scoped
       resource, perform the lookup using the java:app prefix.

     o To reference the jndi-name for a module  scoped  resource,
       perform the lookup using the java:module prefix.

     The jndi-name for  application-scoped-resources  or  module-
     scoped-resources    are    specified    using   the   format
     java:app/jdbc/myDataSource                                or
     java:module/jdbc/myModuleLevelDataSource.  This naming scope
     is   defined   in    the    Java    EE    6    Specification
     (http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/).

OPTIONS

          Name of the application in which the application scoped
