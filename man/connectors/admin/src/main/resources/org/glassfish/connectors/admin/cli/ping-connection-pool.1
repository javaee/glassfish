NAME
     ping-connection-pool - tests if a connection pool is usable

SYNOPSIS
     ping-connection-pool [--help] pool_name

DESCRIPTION
     The ping-connection-pool subcommand  tests  if  an  existing
     JDBC  or  connector connection pool is usable . For example,
     if you create a new JDBC connection pool for an  application
     that  is  expected  to  be  deployed later, the JDBC pool is
     tested with this subcommand before  deploying  the  applica-
     tion.

     Before testing availability of a connection pool,  you  must
     create  the  connection  pool with authentication and ensure
     that the server or database is started.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

     byPool is usable.
