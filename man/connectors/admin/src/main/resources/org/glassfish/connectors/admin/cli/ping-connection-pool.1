asadmin Utility Subcommands;              ping-connection-pool(1)

NAME
     ping-connection-pool - tests if a connection pool is usable

SYNOPSIS
     ping-connection-pool [--help] pool_name

DESCRIPTION
     This subcommand tests if a connection  pool  is  usable  for
     both  JDBC  connection pools and connector connection pools.
     For example, if you create a new JDBC connection pool for an
     application  that is expected to be deployed later, the JDBC
     pool is tested with this  subcommand  before  deploying  the
     application.

     A JDBC connection pool or a connector connection  pool  with
     authentication  can  be  created. You can either use a -pro-
     perty option to specify user, password, or other  connection
     information  using  the command line, or specify the connec-
     tion information in the xml descriptor file.

     Before pinging a connection pool, you must create  the  con-
     nection  pool with authentication and ensure that the enter-
     prise server or database is started.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
