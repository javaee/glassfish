asadmin Utility Subcommands              flush-connection-pool(1)

NAME
     flush-connection-pool -  reintializes all connections  esta-
     blished in the specified connection pool

SYNOPSIS
     flush-connection-pool [--help] pool_name

DESCRIPTION
     The flush-connection-pool subcommand resets a  JDBC  connec-
     tion  pool  or  a  connector  connection pool to its initial
     state. Any existing live connections  are  destroyed,  which
     means  that  the  transactions associated with these connec-
     tions are lost. The subcommand then  recreates  the  initial
     connections  for  the  pool,  and  restores  the pool to its
     steady pool size.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
