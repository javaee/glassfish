asadmin Utility Subcommands              flush-connection-pool(1)

NAME
     flush-connection-pool - reinitializes the connections in the
     specified connection pool

SYNOPSIS
     flush-connection-pool [--help] pool_name

DESCRIPTION
     The flush-connection-pool  subcommand  resets  a  connection
     pool to its initial state for both JDBC connection pools and
     connector connection pools.  Any  existing  connections  are
     destroyed, which means that the transactions associated with
     these connections are lost and must be retired. Finally, the
     subcommand  recreates  the  connections that are established
     for the pool, and restores the pool to its steady pool size.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
