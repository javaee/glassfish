asadmin Utility Subcommands              flush-connection-pool(1)

NAME
     flush-connection-pool - reinitializes the connections in the
     specified connection pool

SYNOPSIS
     flush-connection-pool [--help] pool_name

DESCRIPTION
     The flush-connection-pool  subcommand  resets  a  connection
     pool to its initial state for both JDBC connection pools and
     connector connection pools. It destroys any existing connec-
     tions,  so  any  existing  transactions are lost and must be
     retired. It then recreates connections established  for  the
     pool and restores the pool to its steady pool size.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
