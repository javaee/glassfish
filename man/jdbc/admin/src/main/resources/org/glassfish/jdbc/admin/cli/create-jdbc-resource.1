     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --connectionpoolid
         The name of the JDBC connection pool.  If  two  or  more

         element, they use the same pool connection at runtime.

         time. The default value is true.

     --description
         Text  providing  descriptive  details  about  the   JDBC
         resource.

     --target

         This option helps specify the target to  which  you  are
         deploying. Valid values are:

         server
             Deploys  the  component  to   the   default   server
             instance. This is the default value.

         domain

             Deploys the component to the domain.

         cluster_name
             Deploys the component to every  server  instance  in
             the cluster.

         instance_name

             Deploys  the  component  to   a   particular   sever
             instance.

     Note -

       The resource is always created for the domain as a  whole,
       but  the  <resource-ref>  element for the resource is only
       created  for  the  specified  --target.  This  means  that
       although  the  resource is defined at the domain level, it
       is only active at the specified --target.

OPERANDS
     jndi_name
         The JNDI name of this JDBC resource.
