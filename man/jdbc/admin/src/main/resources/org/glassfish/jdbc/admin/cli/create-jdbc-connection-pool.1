asadmin Utility Subcommands        create-jdbc-connection-pool(1)

     A JDBC connection pool with authentication  can  be  created
     either  by  using a --property option to specify user, pass-
     word, or other connection information, or by specifying  the
     connection information in the XML descriptor file.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --datasourceclassname
         The name of the vendor-supplied JDBC datasource resource
         manager.

     --restype

         The interface that the datasource class implements. Must
         be          one         of         javax.sql.DataSource,
         javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource                    or
         javax.sql.XADataSource.  It  leads to an error when this
         option has a legal value and the indicated interface  is
         not implemented by the datasource class. This option has
         no default value.

     --steadypoolsize
         The minimum and initial number of connections maintained
         in the pool. The default value is 8.

     --maxpoolsize

         The maximum number of connections that can  be  created.
         The default value is 32.

     --maxwait
         The amount of time, in milliseconds, that a caller  will
         wait before a connection timeout is sent. The default is
         60000 (60 seconds). A value of 0 forces  the  caller  to
         wait indefinitely.

     --poolresize

         Quantity by which the pool will scale-up  or  scale-down
         the  number  of connections. Scale up: When the pool has

Java EE 6           Last change: 30 Oct 2009                    2

asadmin Utility Subcommands        create-jdbc-connection-pool(1)

         no free connections, pool will scale up  by  this  quan-
         tity.  Scale  down: All the invalid and idle connections
         are removed, sometimes resulting in removing connections
         of quantity greater than this value. Steadypoolsize will
         be ensured. Possible values are from 0  to  MAX_INTEGER.
         The default value is 2.

     --idletimeout

         The maximum time, in  seconds,  that  a  connection  can
         remain  idle in the pool. After this time, the implemen-
         tation can close this  connection.  This  timeout  value
         must  be kept shorter than the server side timeout value
         to prevent the accumulation of unusable  connections  in
         the application. The default value is 300.

     --initsql
         An SQL string that is executed whenever a connection  is
         created  from  the  pool.  If  an existing connection is
         reused, this string is not executed. This option has  no
         default value.

     --isolationlevel

         The transaction-isolation-level on the  pooled  database
         connections.  This option does not have a default value.
         If not specified, the pool  operates  with  the  default
         isolation  level  that the JDBC driver provides. You can
         set a desired isolation level using one of the  standard
         transaction  isolation  levels:  read-uncommitted, read-
         committed, repeatable-read,  serializable.  Applications
         that  change  the isolation level on a pooled connection
         programmatically risk polluting  the  pool.  This  could
         lead to program errors.

     --isisolationguaranteed
         This is applicable  only  when  a  particular  isolation
         level  is specified for transaction-isolation-level. The
         default value is true.

         This option assures that  every  time  a  connection  is
         obtained  from  the  pool, isolation level is set to the
         desired value. This could have some  performance  impact
         on  some  JDBC  drivers.  Administrators can set this to
         false  when  the  application   does   not   change   --
         isolationlevel before returning the connection.

     --isconnectvalidatereq

         If set to true, connections are validated or checked  to
         see if they are usable before giving out to the applica-
         tion. The default value is false.

     --validationmethod
         The name of the validation table used to perform a query
         to  validate  a  connection.  Valid  settings are: auto-
         commit,  meta-data,  table,  or  custom-validation.  The
         default value is auto-commit.

     --validationtable

         The name of the validation table used to perform a query
         to validate a connection.

     --failconnection
         If set to true, all connections  in  the  pool  must  be
         closed when a single validation check fails. The default
         value is false.  One  attempt  is  made  to  reestablish
         failed connections.

     --allownoncomponentcallers

         A pool with this property set to true  can  be  used  by
         non-Java  EE  components, that is, components other than
         EJBs or Servlets. The returned  connection  is  enlisted
         automatically with the transaction context obtained from
         the transaction manager.

     --nontransactionalconnections
         A pool with this  property  set  to  true  returns  non-
         transactional  connections. This connection does not get
         automatically enlisted with the transaction manager.

     --validateatmostonceperiod

         Specifies the time interval in seconds  between  succes-
         sive request to validate a connection at most once. Set-
         ting this attribute to an  appropriate  value  minimizes
         the  number  of validation requests by a connection. The
         default value is 0, which specifies that the  connection
         is never validated.

     --leaktimeout

         Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, for which con-
         nection leaks in a connection pool are to be traced.

         If connection leak tracing is enabled, you can  use  the
         Administration  Console to enable monitoring of the JDBC
         connection pool to get statistics on the number of  con-
         nection  leaks.  The  default value is 0, which disables
         connection leak tracing.

     --leakreclaim
         Specifies whether leaked connections are restored to the
         connection  pool  after  leak connection tracing is com-
         plete. Possible values are as follows:

         false

             Leaked connections are not restored to  the  connec-
             tion pool (default).

         true
             Leaked connections are restored to   the  connection
             pool.

     --creationretryattempts

         Specifies the maximum number of  times  that  Enterprise
         Server  retries  to  create  a connection if the initial
         attempt fails. The default value is 0,  which  specifies
         that Enterprise Server does not retry to create the con-
         nection.

     --creationretryinterval
         Specifies the interval, in seconds,  between  successive
         attempts to create a connection.

         If    --creationretryattempts    is    0,     the     --
         creationretryinterval  option  is  ignored.  The default
         value is 10.

     --sqltracelisteners

         A list of one or more custom modules that provide custom
         logging  of database activities. Each module must imple-
         ment the  org.glassfish.api.jdbc.SQLTraceListener  pubic
         interface. This option has no default value.

     --statementtimeout

         Specifies the length of time in seconds  after  which  a
         query that is not completed is terminated.

         A query that remains incomplete for  a  long  period  of
         time  might  cause  the  application  that submitted the
         query to hang. To  prevent  this  occurrence,  use  this
         option  set  a  timeout  for all statements that will be
         created from the connection pool that you are  creating.
         When  creating  a  statement, Enterprise Server sets the
         QueryTimeout property on the statement to the length  of
         time  that  is specified. The default value is -1, which
         specifies that incomplete queries are never terminated.

     --lazyconnectionenlistment
         Specifies  whether  a  resource  to  a  transaction   is
         enlisted  only when a method actually uses the resource.
         Possible values are as follows:

         false

             Resources to a transaction are always  enlisted  and
             not  only  when  a method actually uses the resource
             (default).

         true
             Resources to a transaction are enlisted only when  a
             method actually uses the resource.

     --lazyconnectionassociation

         Specifies whether a physical connection should be  asso-
         ciated  with the logical connection only when the physi-
         cal connection is used, and disassociated when the tran-
         saction  is completed. Such association and dissociation
         enable  the  reuse  of  physical  connections.  Possible
         values are as follows:

         false
             A physical connection is associated with the logical
             connection  even  before  the physical connection is
             used, and is not disassociated when the  transaction
             is completed (default).

         true

             A physical connection is associated with the logical

asadmin Utility Subcommands        create-jdbc-connection-pool(1)

             connection  only  when  the  physical  connection is
             used, and disassociated when the transaction is com-
             pleted.   The --lazyconnectionenlistment option must
             also be set to true.

     --associatewiththread

         Specifies whether a connection is  associated  with  the
         thread  to enable the thread to reuse the connection. If
         a connection is not  associated  with  the  thread,  the
         thread  must obtain a connection from the pool each time
         that the thread requires a connection.  Possible  values
         are as follows:

         false
             A connection  is  not  associated  with  the  thread
             (default).

         true

             A connection is associated with the thread.

     --associatewiththreadconnectionscount
         The maximum number of connections to  associate  with  a
         thread.  This  value is used only if associatewiththread
         is true. The default value of this option is 1.

     --driverclassname

         The name of the vendor-supplied JDBC driver class.  This
         driver should implement the java.sql.Driver interface.

     --matchconnections
         Specifies whether a connection that is selected from the
         pool should be matched with the resource adaptor. If all
         connections in the pool are identical, matching  between
         connections  and resource adapters is not required. Pos-
         sible values are as follows:

         false

             A connection should not be matched with the resource
             adaptor (default).

asadmin Utility Subcommands        create-jdbc-connection-pool(1)

         true

             A connection should be  matched  with  the  resource
             adaptor.

     --maxconnectionusagecount
         Specifies the maximum number of times that a  connection
         can  be  reused. When this limit is reached, the connec-
         tion is closed. By limiting the maximum number of  times
         that a connection can be reused, you can avoid statement
         leaks.

         The default value is 0, which specifies no limit on  the
         number of times that a connection can be reused.

     --ping

         Specifies if the pool is pinged during pool creation  or
         reconfiguration  to  identify  and warn of any erroneous
         values for its attributes. Default value is false.

     --pooling
         Specifies if connection pooling is enabled for the pool.
         The default value is true.

     --statementcachesize

         The number of SQL statements  to  be  cached  using  the
         default  caching  mechanism  (Least  Recently Used). The
         default value is 0, which indicates that statement cach-
         ing is not enabled.

     --validationclassname
         The name of the class that  provides  custom  validation
         when the value of validationmethod is custom-validation.
         This       class        must        implement        the
         org.glassfish.api.jdbc.ConnectionValidation   interface,
         and it must be accessible to the application server.

     --wrapjdbcobjects

         Specifies whether the  pooling  infrastructure  provides
         wrapped JDBC objects to applications.

         By providing wrapped JDBC objects, the  pooling  infras-
         tructure  prevents  connection  leaks  by  ensuring that

asadmin Utility Subcommands        create-jdbc-connection-pool(1)

         applications use logical connections from the connection
         pool,  not physical connections. The use of logical con-
         nections ensures that the connections  are  returned  to
         the  connection  pool when they are closed. However, the
         provision of wrapped JDBC objects can impair the perfor-
         mance of applications.

         The pooling infrastructure provides wrapped objects  for
         implementations  of the following interfaces in the JDBC
         API:

             o    java.sql.CallableStatement

             o    java.sql.DatabaseMetaData

             o    java.sql.PreparedStatement

             o    java.sql.ResultSet

             o    java.sql.Statement
         Possible values of --wrapjdbcobjects are as follows:

         false

             The pooling infrastructure does not provide  wrapped
             JDBC objects to applications. (default).

         true
             The pooling infrastructure  provides  wrapped   JDBC
             objects to applications.

     --description

         Text providing details about the specified JDBC  connec-
         tion pool.

         Note -

           If an attribute name or  attribute  value  contains  a
           colon,  the backslash (\fR) must be used to escape the
           colon in the name or  value.  Other  characters  might
           also require an escape character. For more information
           about escape characters in command  options,  see  the
