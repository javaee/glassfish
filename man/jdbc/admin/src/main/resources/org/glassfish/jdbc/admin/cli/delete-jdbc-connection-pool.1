DESCRIPTION
     The delete-jdbc-connection-pool command deletes a JDBC  con-
     nection  pool.  The  operand  identifies the JDBC connection
     pool to be deleted.

     before executing the delete-jdbc-connection-pool command.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help

     --cascade
         If the option is set to true,  all  the  JDBC  resources
         associated  with  the  pool, apart from the pool itself,
         are deleted. When set to false,  the  deletion  of  pool
         fails  if  any  resources  are associated with the pool.
         Resources must be deleted explicitly or the option  must
         be set to true. By default, the option is false.

     --target

         This option is deprecated.
