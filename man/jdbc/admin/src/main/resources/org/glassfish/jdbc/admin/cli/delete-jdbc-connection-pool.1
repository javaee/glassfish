asadmin Utility Subcommands        delete-jdbc-connection-pool(1)

NAME
     delete-jdbc-connection-pool -  removes  the  specified  JDBC
     connection pool

SYNOPSIS
     delete-jdbc-connection-pool [--help]
     [--cascade={false|true}]
     [--target target]
     jdbc_connection_pool_id

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-jdbc-connection-pool subcommand  deletes  a  JDBC
     connection pool. Before running this subcommand, all associ-
     ations to the JDBC connection pool must be removed.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --cascade
         If the option is set to true,  all  the  JDBC  resources
         associated  with  the  pool, apart from the pool itself,
         are deleted. When set to false,  the  deletion  of  pool
         fails  if  any  resources  are associated with the pool.
         Resources must be deleted explicitly or the option  must
         be set to true. The default value is false.

     --target

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     jdbc_connection_pool_id
         The name of the JDBC resource to be removed.
