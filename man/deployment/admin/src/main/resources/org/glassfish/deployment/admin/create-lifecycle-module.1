     create-lifecycle-module [--help] --classname classname
      [--enabled={true|false}] [--target target]
      [--classpath classpath] [--loadorder loadorder]

DESCRIPTION
     The create-lifecycle-module subcommand creates  a  lifecycle
     module.  A  lifecycle  module  provides a means of running a
     short or long duration Java-based task at a  specific  stage
     in  the  server  life cycle. This subcommand is supported in
     remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --classname
         This is the fully qualified name of the startup class.

     --target

         Indicates the location where the lifecycle module is  to
         be created. Valid values are

             o    server- Specifies the default  server  instance
                  as   the  target  for  creating  the  lifecycle
                  module. server  is  the  name  of  the  default
                  server  instance  and  is the default value for
                  this option.

             o    cluster_name- Specifies a particular cluster as
                  the target for creating the lifecycle module.

             o    instance_name- Specifies  a  particular  server
                  instance as the target for creating the lifecy-
                  cle module.

     --classpath
         This option indicates  where  this  module  is  actually
         located  if  it  is  not  under  the  applications  root

         directory.

     --loadorder

         This option represents an integer value that can be used
         to  force  the order in which deployed lifecycle modules
         are loaded at server startup. Smaller  numbered  modules
         are  loaded  sooner. Order is unspecified if two or more
         lifecycle modules have the same load-order value.

     --failurefatal
         This options tells the system what to do if the  lifecy-
         cle  module does not load correctly. When this option is
         set to true, the system aborts  the  server  startup  if
         this module does not load properly. The default value is
         false.

     --enabled

         This option determines whether the resource  is  enabled
         at runtime. The default value is true.

     --description
         This is the text description of the resource  associated
         with this module.

     --property

         This is  an  optional  attribute  containing  name/value
         pairs used to configure the resource.

OPERANDS
     module_name
         This operand is a unique  identifier  for  the  deployed
         server lifecycle event listener module.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Creating a Lifecycle Module

     The following example creates a lifecycle module named  cus-
     tomSetup.

       --classpath "/export/customSetup" --loadorder 1 --failurefatal=true
       --description "this is a sample customSetup"
       --property rmi="Server=acme1:7070":timeout=30 customSetup
       Command create-lifecycle-module executed successfully

     The escape character \fR is used in the property  option  to
     specify  that  the  equal sign (=) and colon (:) are part of
     the rmi property value.

EXIT STATUS
     0                           command executed successfully

     1                           error in executing the command
