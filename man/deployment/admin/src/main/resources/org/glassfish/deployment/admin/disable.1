asadmin Utility Subcommands                            disable(1)

NAME
     disable - disables the component

SYNOPSIS
     disable [--help] [--target target_name] component_name

DESCRIPTION
     The disable subcommand immediately  disables  the  specified
     deployed  component. If the component has not been deployed,
     an error message is returned.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     component_name              name of the component to be dis-
                                 abled.
