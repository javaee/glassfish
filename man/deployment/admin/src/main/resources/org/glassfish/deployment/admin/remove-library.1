NAME
     remove-library - removes one or more library  archive  files
     from GlassFish Server

SYNOPSIS
     remove-library [--help] [--type={common|ext|app}]
     [--target target]
     library-file-path [library-file-path ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     The remove-library subcommand removes one  or  more  library
     archive files from GlassFish Server.

     The --type option specifies the library type and the GlassF-
     ish Server directory from which the library is removed.

     The --target option specifies the target from which you  are
     removing the libraries. If this option specifies the domain,
     the libraries are removed  from  the  configuration  of  the
     domain  administration  server  (DAS) and therefore from the
     entire domain. If this option specifies  any  other  target,
     the libraries are removed from that target only.

     The library-file-path operand is the path to  the  JAR  file
     that contains the library to be removed. To specify multiple
     libraries, specify multiple paths separated by spaces.

     Note

     The library archive file is removed from the DAS. To  remove
     the  libraries from other server instances, synchronize them
     with the DAS by restarting them.

     This Note will no longer be valid when the  --target  option
     is implemented.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help , -?
          Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --type
          Specifies the library type  and  the  GlassFish  Server
          directory  from  which  the  library  is removed. Valid
          values are as follows:

          common
               Removes the library files from  the  Common  class
               loader  directory,  domain-dir/lib.  This  is  the
               default.

          ext  Removes the library files from the  Java  optional
               package directory, domain-dir/lib/ext.

          app  Removes the library files  from  the  application-
               specific    class    loader   directory,   domain-
               dir/lib/applibs.

     For  more  information  about  these  directories,  seeClass
     Loaders  in  Oracle GlassFish Server Application Development
     Guide .

     --target
          Specifies the target from which you  are  removing  the
          libraries. Valid values are as follows:

          server
               Removes the  libraries  from  the  default  server
               instance server. This is the default.

          domain
               Removes the libraries from the domain.

          cluster-name
               Removes the libraries from every  server  instance
               in the cluster.

          instance-name
               Removes the libraries from a particular  GlassFish
               Server instance.

OPERANDS
     library-file-path
          The  paths  to  the  archive  files  that  contain  the
          libraries  that  are  to be removed. You can specify an
          absolute path, only the file name, or a relative path.

          o If you specify an absolute path, the archive file can
            be anywhere.

          o If you specify only the file name, the  archive  file
            must  reside in the directory indicated by the --type
            option.

          o If you specify a relative path, the archive file must
            be  relative  to  the  path  indicated  by the --type
            option.
