NAME
     add-library - adds one or more library JAR files to  GlassF-
     ish Server

SYNOPSIS
     add-library [--help] [--type={common|ext|app}] [--upload={false|true}]
     [--target target]
     library-file-path [library-file-path ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     The add-library subcommand adds one or more library  archive
     files to GlassFish Server.

     The --type option specifies the library type and the GlassF-
     ish Server directory to which the library is added.

     The --target option specifies the target to  which  you  are
     adding  the  libraries. If this option specifies the domain,
     the libraries are added only to  the  configuration  of  the
     domain administration server (DAS). If this option specifies
     any other target, the libraries are added to the  configura-
     tion  of  the  DAS and references are added to the libraries
     from the specified target.

     The library-file-path operand is the path to  the  JAR  file
     that  contains  the library to be added. To specify multiple
     libraries, specify multiple paths separated by spaces.

     Note

     The library archive file is added to the DAS. For common and
     extension  libraries,  you  must  restart  the  DAS  so  the
     libraries are picked up by the server runtime.  To  add  the
     libraries   to   other  server  instances,  synchronize  the
     instances with the DAS by restarting them.

     This Note will no longer be valid when the  --target  option
     is implemented.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help , -?
          Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --type
          Specifies the library type  and  the  GlassFish  Server
          directory  to  which the library is added. Valid values
          are as follows:

          common
               Adds the library files to the Common class  loader

               directory, domain-dir/lib. This is the default.

          ext  Adds the library files to the Java optional  pack-
               age directory, domain-dir/lib/ext.

          app  Adds the library files to the application-specific
               class loader directory, domain-dir/lib/applibs.

     For more information about  these  directories,  see  "Class
     Loaders"  in Oracle GlassFish Server Application Development
     Guide.

     --upload
          Specifies whether the subcommand uploads  the  file  to
          the  DAS.  In most situations, this option can be omit-
          ted.

          Valid values are as follows:

          false
               The  subcommand  does  not  upload  the  file  and
               attempts  to access the file through the specified
               file name. If the DAS cannot access the file,  the
               subcommand fails.

               For example, the DAS might be running  as  a  dif-
               ferent  user than the administration user and does
               not have read access to the file. In  this  situa-
               tion,  the subcommand fails if the --upload option
               is false.

          true The subcommand uploads the file to  the  DAS  over
               the network connection.

     The default value depends on whether the DAS is on the  host
     where the subcommand is run or is on a remote host.

          o If the DAS is on the host  where  the  subcommand  is
            run, the default is false.

          o If the DAS is on a remote host, the default is true.

     If  a  directory  filepath  is  specified,  this  option  is
     ignored.

     --target
          Specifies the  target  to  which  you  are  adding  the
          libraries. Valid values are as follows:

          server
               Adds the libraries to the default server  instance
               server. This is the default.

          domain
               Adds the libraries to the domain.

          cluster-name
               Adds the libraries to every server instance in the
               cluster.

          instance-name
               Adds  the  libraries  to  a  particular  GlassFish
               Server instance.

OPERANDS
     library-file-path
          The  paths  to  the  archive  files  that  contain  the
          libraries  that  are  to  be  added. You can specify an
          absolute path or a relative path.

          If the --upload option is set to true, this is the path
          to  the  file  on  the  local client machine. If the --
          upload option is set to false, this is the path to  the
          file on the server machine.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Adding Libraries

     This example adds the library in the archive file  mylib.jar
     to  the  application-specific  class loader directory on the
     default server instance.
     asadmin> add-library --type app /tmp/mylib.jar
     Command add-library executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
     0    subcommand executed successfully

     1    error in executing the subcommand
