NAME
     undeploy - removes a deployed component

SYNOPSIS
     undeploy [--help] [--target target]  [--droptables={true|false}]
     [--cascade={false|true}] name

DESCRIPTION
     The undeploy subcommand uninstalls a deployed application or
     module and removes it from the repository.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --cascade
         If set to true, deletes all  the  connection  pools  and
         connector resources associated with the resource adapter
         being undeployed. If set to false, the undeploy fails if
         any  pools  and  resources are still associated with the
         resource adapter. Then, either those pools and resources
         must be deleted explicitly, or the option must be set to
         true. If the option is set to false, and if there are no
         pools  and  resources still associated with the resource
         adapter, the resource adapter is undeployed. This option
         is  applicable  to  connectors  (resource  adapters) and
         applications. Default value is false.

     --droptables

         If set to true, drops the tables  that  the  application
         created  by using CMP beans during deployment. If set to
         false, tables are not dropped.  If  not  specified,  the
         value  of  the  drop-tables-at-deploy  entry in the cmp-
         resource element of the sun-ejb-jar.xml file  determines
         whether  or  not  tables  are  dropped. Default value is
         true.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
