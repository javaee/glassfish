NAME
     undeploy - removes a deployed component

SYNOPSIS
     undeploy [--help] [--droptables=true|false]
     [--cascade=false] [--target target] component_name

DESCRIPTION
     The undeploy subcommand uninstalls a deployed application or
     module and removes it from the repository.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --droptables
         Drops the tables that the application created  by  using
         CMP   beans   during  deployment.  The  default  is  the
         corresponding entry in the cmp-resource element  of  the
         sun-ejb-jar.xml  file.  If not specified, it defaults to
         the entries specified in the deployment descriptors.  In
         a  production environment, database tables contain valu-
         able information, so use the  --droptables  option  with
         care.

     --cascade

         If set to true, deletes all  the  connection  pools  and
         connector resources associated with the resource adapter
         being undeployed. If set to false, the undeploy fails if
         any  pools  and  resources are still associated with the
         resource adapter. Then, either those pools and resources
         must be deleted explicitly, or the option must be set to
         true. If the option is set to false, and if there are no
         pools  and  resources still associated with the resource
         adapter, the resource adapter is undeployed. This option
         is  applicable  to  connectors  (resource  adapters) and
         applications. Default is false.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error  does  not  occur.  Instead,  the
