     [--help]
      [ --target  target]
      module_name

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-lifecycle-module subcommand removes  a  lifecycle
     module.  A  lifecycle  module  provides a means of running a
     short or long duration Java-based task at a  specific  stage
     in  the  server  life cycle. This subcommand is supported in
     remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     module_name

         This operand is a unique  identifier  for  the  deployed
         server lifecycle event listener module.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using delete-lifecycle-module

       asadmin> delete-lifecycle-module customSetup
       Command delete-lifecycle-module executed successfully

     Where: customSetup is the lifecycle module deleted.
