NAME
     create-application-ref - creates a reference to an  applica-
     tion

SYNOPSIS
     create-application-ref [--help] [--target target]
     [--virtualservers virtual_servers] [--enabled=true]
     [--lbenabled=true] reference_name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-application-ref subcommand  creates  a  reference
     from a cluster or an unclustered server instance to a previ-
     ously deployed application element (for example, a  Java  EE
     application,  a  Web  module, or an enterprise bean module).
     This effectively results in the  application  element  being
     deployed  and  made  available  on  the targeted instance or
     cluster.

     The target instance or instances making up the cluster  need
     not  be running or available for this subcommand to succeed.
     If one or  more  instances  are  not  available,  they  will
     receive  the  new  application  element  the  next time they
     start.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Specifies the target for  which  you  are  creating  the
         application reference. Valid values are

             o    server- Specifies the default  server  instance
                  as  the  target  for  creating  the application
                  reference. server is the name  of  the  default
                  server  instance  and  is the default value for
                  this option.

             o    cluster_name- Specifies a particular cluster as
                  the  target for creating the application refer-
                  ence.

             o    instance_name- Specifies  a  particular  server
                  instance   as   the  target  for  creating  the

                  application reference.

     --virtualservers

         Specifies a comma-separated list of virtual  server  IDs
         on  which  to  deploy.  This  option applies only to Web
         modules (either standalone or in a Java EE application).
         If  this  option  is  not  specified, the application is
         deployed to all virtual servers except  the  administra-
         tive server, __asadmin.

     --enabled
         Indicates whether  the  application  should  be  enabled
         (that  is,  loaded). This value will take effect only if
         the application is enabled  at  the  global  level.  The
         default is true.

     --lbenabled

         Controls whether the deployed application  is  available
         for load balancing. The default is true.

OPERANDS
     reference_name
         The name of the application or module, which  can  be  a
         Java  EE  application, Web module, EJB module, connector
         module, application client module, or lifecycle module.

         The name can include  an  optional  version  identifier,
         which follows the name and is separated from the name by
         a colon (:). The version identifier must  begin  with  a
         letter or number. It can contain alphanumeric characters
         plus underscore (_), dash (-), and  period  (.)  charac-
         ters.  If  the --enabled option is set to false, you can
         create references to multiple disabled versions by using
         an asterisk (*) as a wildcard character. For more infor-
         mation about module and application  versions,  see  the
         Oracle   GlassFish  Server  3.1  Application  Deployment
         Guide.
