asadmin Utility Subcommands                             enable(1)

NAME
     enable - enables the component

SYNOPSIS
     enable [--help] [--target target_name] [component_name]

DESCRIPTION
     The enable subcommand enables the  specified  deployed  com-
     ponent.  If the component is already enabled, then it is re-
     enabled. If it has not been deployed, then an error  message
     is returned.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     component_name              name  of  the  component  to  be
                                 enabled.
