NAME
     list-applications - lists deployed applications

SYNOPSIS
     list-applications [--help]
     [--long={false|true}] [--resources] [--subcomponents]
     [--type type] [target]

DESCRIPTION
     The list-applications  subcommand  lists  deployed  Java  EE
     applications  and  the  type  of  each  application  that is
     listed.

     If the --type option is not specified, all applications  are
     listed.  If the type option is specified, you must specify a
     type. The possible types are listed in the  Options  section
     of this help page.

     If  multiple  versions  of  a  module  or  application   are
     deployed,  this subcommand lists all versions. To list which
     version is enabled, set the --long option to true. For  more
     information  about  module  and  application  versions,  see
     theModule  and  Application  Versions  in  Oracle  GlassFish
     Server Application Deployment Guide .

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

     --subcomponents
          Lists the subcomponents of each application.  The  sub-

          are  listed.  For  a  web application, servlets and JSP
