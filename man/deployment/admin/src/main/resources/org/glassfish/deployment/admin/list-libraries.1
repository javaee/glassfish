NAME
     list-libraries - lists library JAR files on GlassFish Server

SYNOPSIS
     list-libraries [--help] [--type={common|ext|app}]
     [--target target]

DESCRIPTION
     The list-libraries subcommand lists library archive files on
     GlassFish Server.

     The --type option specifies the library type and the GlassF-
     ish Server directory for which libraries are to be listed.

     The --target option specifies the target for which  you  are
     listing  the libraries. If this option specifies the domain,
     all libraries are listed for  the  entire  domain.  If  this
     option  specifies any other target, the libraries are listed
     for that target only.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help , -?
          Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --type
          Specifies the library type  and  the  GlassFish  Server
          directory  for which libraries are listed. Valid values
          are as follows:

          common
               Lists the  library  files  for  the  Common  class
               loader  directory,  domain-dir/lib.  This  is  the
               default.

          ext  Lists the library  files  for  the  Java  optional
               package directory, domain-dir/lib/ext.

          app  Lists  the  library  files  for  the  application-
               specific    class    loader   directory,   domain-
               dir/lib/applibs.

     For more information about  these  directories,  see  "Class
