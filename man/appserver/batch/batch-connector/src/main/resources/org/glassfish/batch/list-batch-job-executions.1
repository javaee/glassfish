       --long, -l
           Displays detailed information about jobs. The default value is
           false.

       --output, -o
           Displays specific details about jobs. Use a comma-separated list to
           specify the details you want to display and their order. The values
           are case-insensitive. A subset of all possible headings is
           displayed by default.

           Possible values are as follows:

           jobname
               Displays the name of the job.

           instanceid

               execution ID changes throughout the life of the job. An
               execution ID is assigned each time a job with a specific
               instance ID is started or restarted (executed).

           starttime
               Displays the start time of the job.

           endtime
               Displays the finish time of the job.

           jobparameters
               Displays the parameters for the job.

           stepcount
               Displays the step count for the job.

       --header, -h
           Specifies whether column headings are displayed when the --long
           option is used. The default value is true. To suppress the
           headings, set the --header option to false.
