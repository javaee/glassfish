       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

           Displays detailed information about the jobs. The default value is
           false.

       --output, -o
           Displays specific details about each job. Use a comma-separated
           list to specify the details you want to display and their order.
           The values are case-insensitive. The jobname and instancecount
           column headings are displayed by default.

           Possible values are as follows:

           jobname
               Displays the name of the job.

           appname
               Displays the name of the application.

               Displays the number of times a job instance has been started
               and restarted (executed).

           instanceid
               Displays the instance ID of the job. The instance ID stays the
               same throughout the life of the job.

               Displays the execution ID of a specific job instance. The
               execution ID changes throughout the life of the job. An

               instance ID is started or restarted (executed).

       --header, -h
           Specifies whether column headings are displayed when the --long
           option is used. The default value is true. To suppress the
           headings, set the --header option to false.
