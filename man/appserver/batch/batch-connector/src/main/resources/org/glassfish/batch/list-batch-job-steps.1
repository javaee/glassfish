           The values are case-insensitive. A subset of all possible headings
           is displayed by default.

               Displays the name of the step.

           stepid

           stepmetrics
               Displays metrics for each step.

           value
               Displays a value for each step metric. The value indicates how

       --header, -h
           Specifies whether column headings are displayed when the --long
