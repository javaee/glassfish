           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which to list batch job steps. Valid
           values are as follows:

           server
               Lists steps for the default server instance server and is the
               default value.

           cluster-name
               Lists steps for every server instance in the cluster.

           instance-name
               Lists steps for a particular server instance.

       --long, -l
           Displays all details. The default value is false.

       --output, -o
           Displays specific details. Use a comma-separated list to specify
           the details to display and their order. The values are
           case-insensitive. A subset of all possible headings is displayed by
           default.

           Possible values are as follows:

           stepname
               Displays the name of the step.

           stepid
               Displays the step ID.

           starttime
               Displays the start time of the step.

           endtime
               Displays the finish time of the step.

           batchstatus
               Displays whether the job completed or failed.

           exitstatus
               Displays whether steps in the application completed or failed.

           stepmetrics
               Displays metrics for each step.

           value
               Displays a value for each step metric. The value indicates how
               many times items were read, written, and so on.

       --header, -h
           Specifies whether column headings are displayed when the --long
           option is used. The default value is true. To suppress the
           headings, set the --header option to false.

OPERANDS
       execution_id
           The execution ID for which to list batch job steps and details.
