NAME
       set-batch-runtime-configuration - configures the batch runtime

SYNOPSIS
           set-batch-runtime-configuration [--help]
           [--target target]
           [--datasourcelookupname datasource-lookup-name]
           [--executorservicelookupname executor-service-lookup-name]

DESCRIPTION
       The set-batch-runtime-configuration subcommand configures the batch
       runtime. The runtime uses a data source and a managed executor service
       to execute batch jobs.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target for which to configure the batch runtime.
           Valid values are as follows:

           server
               Configures the batch runtime for the default server instance
               server and is the default value.

           cluster-name
               Configures the batch runtime for every server instance in the
               cluster.

           instance-name
               Configures the batch runtime for a particular server instance.

       --datasourcelookupname, -d
           The JNDI lookup name of the data source to be used to store job
           information. The default data source is jdbc/__TimerPool.

       --executorservicelookupname , -x
           The JNDI lookup name of the managed executor service to be used to
           execute jobs. The default managed executor service is
           concurrent/__defaultManagedExecutorService.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Configuring the Batch Runtime
           The following example configures the batch runtime for the default
           server instance to use an existing managed executor service named
           concurrent/myExecutor.

               asadmin> configure-batch-runtime --executorservicelookupname concurrent/myExecutor
               Command set-batch-runtime-configuration executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           subcommand executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the subcommand
