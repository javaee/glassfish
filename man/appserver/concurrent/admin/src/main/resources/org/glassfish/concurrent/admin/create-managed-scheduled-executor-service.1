DESCRIPTION
       The create-managed-scheduled-executor-service subcommand creates a
       managed scheduled executor service resource.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --enabled
           Specifies whether the managed scheduled executor service resource
           is enabled at runtime.

           The default value is true.

       --contextinfo
           A comma separated string specifying a list of context types to be
           propagated. Context types are Security, Classloader, JNDI, and
           WorkArea. If omitted, all context types are propagated.

       --threadpriority
           Specifies the priority of threads to be created for the managed
           scheduled executor service instance.

           The default value is 5.

       --longrunningtasks
           Specifies how a container should handle threads.For example, if set
           to true, stuck threads will not be reported and shutdown of the
           managed scheduled executor service will not be blocked waiting for
           long-running tasks. The default value is false.

       --hungafterseconds
           Specifies the amount of time in seconds that a task can execute
           before it is considered hung. If omitted, tasks will never be
           considered hung.

       --corepoolsize
           Specifies the number of threads to keep in a thread pool.

           The default value is 0.

       ---maximumpoolsize
           Specifies the maximum number of threads a thread pool can contain.

           The default value is 2147483647.

       --keepaliveseconds
           Specifies the time in seconds threads can remain idle when the
           number of threads is greater than core size.

           The default value is 60.

       --threadlifetimeseconds
           Specifies the time in seconds each thread remains in a thread pool
           before it is purged, regardless of whether the number of threads is
           greater than core size or whether the thread is idle. Threads are
           not interrupted while executing requests. Threads exceeding the
           thread-lifetime-seconds value are not returned to the thread pool
           after completion of the current request.

           The default value is 0.

       --taskqueuecapacity
           Specifies the size of the queue holding submitted tasks waiting to
           be executed.

           The default value is 2147483647.

       --description
           Text providing descriptive details about the managed scheduled
           executor service.

       --property
           Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the managed
           executor service instance.

       --target
           TBD

OPERANDS
       jndi_name
           The JNDI name to look up the managed scheduled executor service
           instance.
