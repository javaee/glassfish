asadmin Utility Subcommands        disable-http-lb-application(1)

NAME
     disable-http-lb-application  -   disables   an   application
     managed by a load balancer

SYNOPSIS
     disable-http-lb-application [--help] [--timeout 30]
      --name application_nametarget

DESCRIPTION
     The disable disable-http-lb-application subcommand  disables
     an  application for load balancing. The disabled application
     goes offline for  load  balancing  with  minimal  impact  to
     users. Disabling an application gives a finer granularity of
     control than disabling a server instance and is most  useful
     when a cluster is hosting multiple independent applications.

     Once the application is disabled and the changes  have  been
     applied  to the load balancer, new requests for the applica-
     tion are not forwarded to the target. Existing sessions con-
     tinue  to  access  the  application  until  the  timeout  is
     reached. This process is known as quiescing.

     If an application is deployed across multiple clusters,  use
     this  subcommand  to disable it in one cluster while leaving
     it enabled in others.

     If an application is deployed to a single  server  instance,
     use  this  subcommand  to  disable it in that instance while
     leaving the instance itself enabled.

     Note

     This subcommand  is  only  applicable  to  Oracle  GlassFish
     Server.  This  subcommand  is  not  applicable  to GlassFish
     Server Open Source Edition.

OPTIONS
     --help , -?
          Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --timeout
          The timeout (in minutes) to wait before  disabling  the
          specified  application. This time allows for the grace-
          ful shutdown (quiescing) of the specified  application.
          The default value is 30 minutes. The minimum value is 1
          minute.

     --name
          The name of the application to be disabled.
