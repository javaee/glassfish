NAME
     migrate-timers - moves EJB timers  when  a  server  instance
     stops

SYNOPSIS
     migrate-timers  [--help] [--target target_server_name]
      server_name

DESCRIPTION
     The migrate-timers subcommand moves EJB timers to  a  speci-
     fied  server  when  a  server instance stops or fails abnor-
     mally. This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         This is the target server instance. If  this  option  is
         not  specified,  then DAS will find a server instance or
         multiple server instances. A migration notification will
         be sent to the selected server instances.

     --destination

         This option is deprecated. It works exactly  as  the  --
         target option does.

OPERANDS
     server_name
         This is the server instance  on  which  the  timers  are
         currently  located.  This  server instance should not be
         active during the migration process.
