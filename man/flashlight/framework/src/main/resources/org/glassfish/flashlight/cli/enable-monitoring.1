NAME
     enable-monitoring - enables monitoring for the server or for
     specific monitorable objects

SYNOPSIS
     enable-monitoring [--help] [--mbean={false|true}] [--dtrace={true|false]
     --modules module-name[=level][:module-name[=level]]* [--pid=pid]
     [--options option-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The enable-monitoring subcommand is used to turn on monitor-
     ing  for  Enterprise Server or for particular modules during
     runtime. Changes are dynamic, that is, server restart is not
     required.

     By default, the monitoring service is enabled, that is,  the
     monitoring-enabled  attribute of the monitoring-service ele-
     ment is true. However,  the  default  monitoring  level  for
     individual  modules is OFF. This subcommand used with the --
     modules option can enable monitoring for a given  module  by
     setting the monitoring level to HIGH or LOW. If level is not
     specified when running the subcommand, the level defaults to
     HIGH.

     The specific meanings of HIGH or LOW are determined  by  the
     individual  containers.  For  a list of monitorable modules,
     see the --modules option in this help page.

     An alternative method for enabling monitoring is to use  the
     set  subcommand.  In this case, the server must be restarted
     for changes to take effect.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --mbean
         Enables Mbean monitoring. Default is false.

         SolarisTM DTrace monitoring. Default is false.

     --modules

         Enables specified module or modules by indicating  moni-
         toring  level. Valid levels are OFF, HIGH, LOW. If level
         is not specified,  default  setting  is  HIGH.  Multiple
         modules  are separated by : (colon). Monitorable modules
         include  connector-connection-pool,   connector-service,
         ejb-container,  http-service, jdbc-connection-pool, jer-
         sey,  jpa,  jms-service,  jvm,  security,   thread-pool,
         transaction-service,  web-container,  and  web-services-
         container. Additional modules can be listed by using the
         get subcommand.

     --pid=pid
         Specifies the Enterprise Server JVM  process  identifier
         (PID).  When  monitoring is enabled, the btrace-agent is
         attached, based on the specified PID.  Need  to  specify
         only  in exceptional cases when the system cannot deter-
         mine the PID. In this situation, the subcommand  prompts
         for  the  PID of the corresponding Enterprise Serverpro-
         cess.

     --options

         Sets the following btrace-agent options:

         debug=false

         dumpClasses=false

         probeDescPath=/foo/bar

         noServer=true,script=$1
