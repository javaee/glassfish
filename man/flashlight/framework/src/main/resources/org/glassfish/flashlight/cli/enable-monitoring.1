asadmin Utility Subcommands                  enable-monitoring(1)

NAME
     enable-monitoring - enables monitoring for the server or for
     specific monitorable modules

SYNOPSIS
     enable-monitoring [--help]
     [--mbean={false|true}]
     [--dtrace={true|false]
     [--modules modules[=level][:module[=level]]*
     [--pid pid]
     [--options options={true|false]]

DESCRIPTION
     The enable-monitoring subcommand is used to turn on monitor-
     ing  for  Enterprise Server or for particular modules during
     runtime. Changes are dynamic, that is, server restart is not
     required.

     By default, the monitoring service is enabled, that is,  the
     monitoring-enabled  attribute of the monitoring-service ele-
     ment is true. However,  the  default  monitoring  level  for
     individual  modules is OFF. This subcommand used with the --
     modules option can enable monitoring for a given  module  by
     setting the monitoring level to HIGH or LOW. If level is not
     specified when running the subcommand, the level defaults to
     HIGH.

     The specific meanings of HIGH or LOW are determined  by  the
     individual  containers.  For  a list of monitorable modules,
     see the --modules option in this help page.

     An alternative method for enabling monitoring is to use  the
     set  subcommand.  In this case, the server must be restarted
     for changes to take effect.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --mbean
         Enables Mbean monitoring. Default value is false.

     --dtrace

         Only usable if tTM DTrace Monitoring module is  present.
         Enables  Solaris    DTrace  monitoring. Default value is
         false.

     --modules
         Enables specified module or modules by indicating  moni-
         toring  level. Valid levels are OFF, HIGH, LOW. If level
         is not specified, the default setting is HIGH.  Multiple
         modules  are separated by : (colon). Monitorable modules
         include  connector-connection-pool,   connector-service,
         ejb-container,  http-service, jdbc-connection-pool, jer-
         sey,  jpa,  jms-service,  jvm,  security,   thread-pool,
         transaction-service, web-container, jruby-container, and
         web-services-container. Additional modules can be listed
         by using the get subcommand.

         To set the level of JRuby container monitoring you  need
         to  deploy  at  least  one  Ruby  application or use the
         configure-jruby-container subcommand to enable  monitor-
         ing.   For   more   information,   see  configure-jruby-
         container(1).

     --pid

         Specifies the Enterprise Server JVM  process  identifier
         (PID).  When  monitoring is enabled, the btrace-agent is
         attached, based on the specified PID.  Need  to  specify
         only  in exceptional cases when the system cannot deter-
         mine the PID. In this situation, the subcommand  prompts
         for  the  PID of the corresponding Enterprise Serverpro-
         cess.

     --options
         Sets the following btrace-agent options:

         debug

             Enables  debugging  for  BTrace.  Default  value  is
             false.
