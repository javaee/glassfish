NAME
     disable-monitoring - disables monitoring for the  server  or
     for specific monitorable modules

SYNOPSIS
     disable-monitoring [--help] [--modules module-name][:module-name]*

DESCRIPTION
     The disable-monitoring subcommand is used to turn off  moni-
     toring  for Enterprise Server or for particular modules dur-
     ing runtime. Changes are dynamic, that is, server restart is
     not required.

     Running the disable-monitoring  subcommand  without  the  --
     module option disables the monitoring service by setting the
     monitoring-enabled attribute of the monitoring-service  ele-
     ment  to false. The individual modules retain their monitor-
     ing levels, but no monitoring data is generated because  the
     entire monitoring service is disabled.

     This subcommand used with the --modules option disables mon-
     itoring for a module by setting the monitoring level to OFF.
     The status of the monitoring service is not affected. For  a
     list  of  monitorable  modules,  see the --modules option in
     this help page.

     An alternative method for disabling monitoring is to use the
     set  subcommand.  In this case, the server must be restarted
     for changes to take effect.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
