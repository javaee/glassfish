attach(1)                 asadmin Utility Subcommands                attach(1)

NAME
       attach - attaches to a subcommand that was started using asadmin
       --detach

SYNOPSIS
           attach  [--help]
           jobid

DESCRIPTION
       The attach subcommand attaches to a subcommand that was started using
       the asadmin utility option --detach, which detaches long-running
       subcommands and executes them in the background in detach mode. Job IDs
       are assigned to subcommands (jobs) that are started using asadmin
       --detach. The attach subcommand enables you to view the status of a job
       and its output.

       You can use the list-jobs(1) subcommand to view the jobs and their job
       IDs, and the configure-managed-jobs(1) subcommand to configure how long
       information about the jobs is kept.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

OPERANDS
       jobid
           The ID of the job for which you want to view status and output.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Attaching to a Subcommand and Checking Its Status
           This example attaches to the deploy subcommand with a job ID of 20
           and shows that the job has completed. If a subcommand is still in
           progress, the output displays the current status, for example, 64%:
           Uploading bits.

               asadmin> attach 20

               Command attach executed successfully.

           subcommand executed successfully
