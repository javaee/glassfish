asadmin Utility Subcommands                     remove-library(1)

NAME
     remove-library - removes one or more library JAR files  from
     GlassFish Server

SYNOPSIS
     remove-library [--help] [--type={common|ext|app}]
     [--target target]
     library-name [library-name ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     The remove-library subcommand removes one  or  more  library
     JAR files from GlassFish Server.

     The --type option specifies the library type and the GlassF-
     ish Server directory from which the library is removed.

     The --target option specifies the target from which you  are
     removing the libraries. If this option specifies the domain,
     the libraries are removed  from  the  configuration  of  the
     domain  administration  server  (DAS) and therefore from the
     entire domain. If this option specifies  any  other  target,
     the libraries are removed from that target only.

     The library-name operand is the name of the  JAR  file  that
     contains  the  library  to  be  removed. To specify multiple
     libraries, specify multiple names separated by spaces.

     Note

     The library archive file is removed from the DAS. For common
     and  extension  libraries,  you  must restart the DAS so the
     library removals are picked up by  the  server  runtime.  To
     remove  the libraries from other server instances, synchron-
     ize the instances with the DAS by restarting them.

     This command is not supported on the Windows operating  sys-
     tem.

     This Note will no longer be valid when the  --target  option
     is implemented.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help , -?
          Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --type
          Specifies the library type  and  the  GlassFish  Server
          directory  from  which  the  library  is removed. Valid
          values are as follows:

asadmin Utility Subcommands                     remove-library(1)

          common
               Removes the library files from  the  Common  class
               loader  directory,  domain-dir/lib.  This  is  the
               default.

          ext  Removes the library files from the  Java  optional
               package directory, domain-dir/lib/ext.

          app  Removes the library files  from  the  application-
               specific    class    loader   directory,   domain-
               dir/lib/applibs.

     For more information about  these  directories,  see  "Class
     Loaders"  in Oracle GlassFish Server Application Development
     Guide.

     --target
          Specifies the target from which you  are  removing  the
          libraries. Valid values are as follows:

          server
               Removes the  libraries  from  the  default  server
               instance server. This is the default.

          domain
               Removes the libraries from the domain.

          cluster-name
               Removes the libraries from every  server  instance
               in the cluster.

          instance-name
               Removes the libraries from a particular  GlassFish
               Server instance.

OPERANDS
     library-name
          The names of the JAR files that contain  the  libraries
          that are to be removed.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Removing Libraries

     This  example  removes  the  library  in  the  archive  file
     mylib.jar  from the application-specific class loader direc-
     tory on the default server instance.
