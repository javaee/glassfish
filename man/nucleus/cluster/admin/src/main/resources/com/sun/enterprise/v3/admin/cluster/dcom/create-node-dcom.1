DESCRIPTION
       The create-node-dcom subcommand creates a node that is enabled for
       communication over the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) remote
       protocol. The DCOM protocol is available only on Windows systems.

       A node represents a host on which the GlassFish Server software is
       installed. A node must exist for every host on which GlassFish Server
       instances reside.

       In a DCOM-enabled network, the domain administration server (DAS)
       contacts a node's host through the DCOM connector to manage GlassFish
       Server instances that reside on the node. DCOM is used only for
       communications between hosts. DCOM is never used for communications
       within a single host.

       By default, the subcommand fails and the node is not created if the DAS
       cannot contact the node's host through DCOM. To force the node to be
       created in the DAS configuration even if the host cannot be contacted
       through DCOM, set the --force option to true.

       The create-node-dcom subcommand cannot create a node that represents
       the local host, that is, the host on which the subcommand is run. The
       subcommand fails regardless of how the local host is specified, for
       example, by using the keyword localhost, the Internet Protocol (IP)
       address of the host, or the host name.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --nodehost
           The name of the host that the node represents. The name of the host
           must be specified. Otherwise, an error occurs.

       --installdir
           The full path to the parent of the base installation directory of
           the GlassFish Server software on the host, for example,
           C:\glassfish3. The default is the parent of the default base
           installation directory of the GlassFish Server software for the
           DAS. This default is useful only if GlassFish Server is installed
           in the same location on all hosts.

       --nodedir
           The path to the directory that is to contain GlassFish Server
           instances that are created on the node. The default is
           as-install\nodes, where as-install is the base installation
           directory of the GlassFish Server software on the host. If a
           relative path is specified, the path is relative to the as-install
           directory.

       --windowsuser, -w
           The user on this node's host that is to run the process for
           connecting to the host through DCOM. The default is the user that
           is running the DAS process. If the --nodehost option is set to
           localhost-domain, the --windowsuser option is ignored

       --windowsdomain, -d
           The name of the Windows domain that contains the user that the
           --windowsuser option specifies. The default is the name of the host
           on which the subcommand is run.

       --force
           Specifies whether the node is created in the DAS configuration even
           if validation of the node's parameters fails. To validate a node's
           parameters, the DAS must be able to contact the node's host through
           DCOM. Possible values are as follows:

           false
               The node is not created if validation of the node's parameters
               fails (default).

           true
               The node is created even if validation of the node's parameters
               fails.

       --install
           Specifies whether the subcommand shall install the GlassFish Server
           software on the host that the node represents.

           Possible values are as follows:

           false
               The subcommand shall not install the GlassFish Server software
               on the host (default).

           true
               The subcommand shall install the GlassFish Server software on
               the host.

       --archive
           The absolute path to the archive file of the GlassFish Server
           software that is to be installed. If this option is omitted and the
           --install is true, the subcommand creates a ZIP archive of the
           GlassFish Server software from the installation where this
           subcommand is run. The archive does not contain the domains
           directory or the nodes directory.

OPERANDS
       node-name
           The name of the node.

           The name must meet the following requirements:

           *   The name may contain only ASCII characters.

           *   The name must start with a letter, a number, or an underscore.

           *   The name may contain only the following characters:

               *   Lowercase letters

               *   Uppercase letters

               *   Numbers

               *   Hyphen

               *   Period

               *   Underscore

           *   The name must be unique in the domain and must not be the name
               of another node, a cluster, a named configuration, or a
               GlassFish Server instance.

           *   The name must not be domain, server, or any other keyword that
               is reserved by GlassFish Server.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating a Node
           This example creates the node wpmdl1 for the host
           wpmdl1.example.com. By default, the parent of the base installation
           directory of the GlassFish Server software is C:\glassfish3.

               asadmin> create-node-dcom
               --nodehost wpmdl1.example.com wpmdl1
               Command create-node-dcom executed successfully.

       Example 2, Creating a Node With a Specific Installation Directory
           This example creates the node wyml1 for the host wyml1.example.com.
           The parent of the base installation directory of the GlassFish
           Server software on this host is C:\middleware\glassfish3.

               asadmin> create-node-dcom --installdir C:\middleware\glassfish3
               --nodehost wyml1.example.com wyml1
               Command create-node-dcom executed successfully.

       Example 3, Forcing the Creation of a Node
           This example forces the creation of node xkyd for the host
           xkyd.example.com. The node is created despite the failure of the
           DAS to contact the host xkyd.example.com to validate the node's
           parameters.

               asadmin> create-node-dcom --force --nodehost xkyd.example.com xkyd
               Warning: some parameters appear to be invalid.
               com.sun.enterprise.universal.process.WindowsException: Connection in error
               Continuing with node creation due to use of --force.
               Command create-node-dcom executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
