list-nodes-dcom(1)        asadmin Utility Subcommands       list-nodes-dcom(1)

NAME
       list-nodes-dcom - lists all GlassFish Server nodes that support
       communication over DCOM in a domain

SYNOPSIS
           list-nodes-dcom [--help] [--long={false|true}]

DESCRIPTION
       The list-nodes-dcom subcommand lists all GlassFish Server nodes that
       support communication over the Distributed Component Object Model
       (DCOM) remote protocol. The DCOM protocol is available only on Windows
       systems.

           Note
           +-------------------------------------+
           |                                     |
           |           To list all nodes in a    |
           |           domain regardless of the  |
           |           type of the node, run the |
           |           list-nodes(1) subcommand. |
           +-------------------------------------+

       By default, the subcommand displays the following information for each
       node that is listed:

       *   The name of the node

       *   The type of the node, which is DCOM

       *   The name of the host that the node represents

       The --long option of the subcommand specifies whether the nodes are
       listed in long format. In long format, the following additional
       information about each node is displayed:

       *   The path to the parent of the base installation directory of
           GlassFish Server on the host that the node represents

       *   A comma-separated list of the names of the GlassFish Server
           instances that reside on the node

       If the --terse option of the asadmin(1M) utility is true and the --long
       option of the subcommand is false, the subcommand lists only the name
       of each node.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --long, -l
           Specifies whether the nodes are listed in long format.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The nodes are listed in long format.

           false
               The nodes are listed in short format (default).

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Listing GlassFish Server Nodes
           This example displays the name, type, and host for all GlassFish
           Server nodes that support communication over DCOM in a domain.

               asadmin> list-nodes-dcom
               xkyd  DCOM  xkyd.example.com
               wpmdl2  DCOM  wpmdl2.example.com
               wpmdl1  DCOM  wpmdl1.example.com
               Command list-nodes-dcom executed successfully.

       Example 2, Listing Only the Names of GlassFish Server Nodes
           This example uses the --terse option of the asadmin utility to list
           only the names of the GlassFish Server nodes that support
           communication over DCOM in a domain.

               asadmin> list-nodes-dcom --terse=true
               xkyd
               wpmdl2
               wpmdl1

       Example 3, Listing GlassFish Server Nodes in Long Format
           This example lists the GlassFish Server nodes that support
           communication over DCOM in a domain in long format.

               asadmin> list-nodes-dcom --long=true
               NODE NAME    TYPE   NODE HOST            INSTALL DIRECTORY   REFERENCED BY
               xkyd         DCOM   xkyd.example.com     C:\glassfish3
               wpmdl2       DCOM   wpmdl2.example.com   C:\glassfish3       wdi2
               wpmdl1       DCOM   wpmdl1.example.com   C:\glassfish3       wdi1
               Command list-nodes-dcom executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
           error in executing the command
