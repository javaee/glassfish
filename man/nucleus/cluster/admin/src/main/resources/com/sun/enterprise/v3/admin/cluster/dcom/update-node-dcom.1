NAME
       update-node-dcom - updates the configuration data of a node

SYNOPSIS
           update-node-dcom [--help]
           [--nodehost node-host]
           [--installdir as-install-parent] [--nodedir node-dir]
           [--windowsuser windows-user] [--windowsdomain windows-domain]
           [--force={false|true}]
           node-name

DESCRIPTION
       The update-node-dcom subcommand updates the configuration data of a
       node. This subcommand requires the Distributed Component Object Model
       (DCOM) remote protocol to be configured on the host where the domain
       administration server (DAS) is running and on the host where the node
       resides. The DCOM protocol is available only on Windows systems.You may
       run this subcommand from any host that can contact the DAS.

       This subcommand can update any node, regardless of whether the node is
       enabled for remote communication. If the node is not enabled for remote
       communication, the subcommand enables DCOM communication for the node
       and updates any other specified configuration data.

       Options of this subcommand specify the new values of the node's
       configuration data. The default for most options is to leave the
       existing value unchanged. However, if this subcommand is run to enable
       DCOM communication for a node, default values are applied if any of the
       following options is omitted:

       *   --windowsuser

       *   --windowsdomain

       By default, the subcommand fails and the node is not updated if the DAS
       cannot contact the node's host through DCOM. To force the node to be
       updated even if the host cannot be contacted through DCOM, set the
       --force option to true.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --nodehost
           The name of the host that the node is to represent after the node
           is updated.

       --installdir
           The full path to the parent of the base installation directory of
           the GlassFish Server software on the host, for example,
           /export/glassfish3/.

       --nodedir
           The path to the directory that is to contain GlassFish Server
           instances that are created on the node. If a relative path is
           specified, the path is relative to the as-install directory, where
           as-install is the base installation directory of the GlassFish
           Server software on the host.

       --windowsuser, -w
           The user on this node's host that is to run the process for
           connecting to the host through DCOM. The default depends on whether
           this subcommand is run to enable DCOM communication for the node:

           *   If the node is already enabled for communication over DCOM, the
               default is to leave the user unchanged.

           *   If this subcommand is run to enable DCOM communication for the
               node, the default is the user that is running the DAS process.

           If the --nodehost option is set to localhost, the --windowsuser
           option is ignored.

       --windowsdomain, -d
           The name of the Windows domain that contains the user that the
           --windowsuser option specifies. The default depends on whether this
           subcommand is run to enable DCOM communication for the node:

           *   If the node is already enabled for communication over DCOM, the
               default is to leave the domain unchanged.

           *   If this subcommand is run to enable DCOM communication for the
               node, the default is the name of the host on which the
               subcommand is run.

       --force
           Specifies whether the node is updated even if validation of the
           node's parameters fails. To validate a node's parameters, the DAS
           must be able to contact the node's host through DCOM. Possible
           values are as follows:

           false
               The node is not updated if validation of the node's parameters
               fails (default).

           true
               The node is updated even if validation of the node's parameters
               fails.

OPERANDS
       node-name
           The name of the node to update. The node must exist. Otherwise, an
           error occurs.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Updating the Host That a Node Represents
           This example updates the host that the node wpmdl1 represents to
           wj01.

               asadmin> update-node-dcom --nodehost wj01 wpmdl1
               Command update-node-dcom executed successfully.

       Example 2, Forcing the Update of a Node
           This example forces the update of the node xkyd to enable the node
           to communicate over DCOM.

               asadmin> update-node-dcom --force xkyd
               Warning: some parameters appear to be invalid.
               Could not find a remote Glassfish installation on host: xkyd.example.com at
               C:\glassfish3\glassfish
               Continuing with node update due to use of --force.
               Command update-node-dcom executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           command executed successfully

       1
