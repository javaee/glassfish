ping-node-dcom(1)         asadmin Utility Subcommands        ping-node-dcom(1)

NAME
       ping-node-dcom - tests if a node that is enabled for communication over
       DCOM is usable

SYNOPSIS
           ping-node-dcom [--help]
           [--validate={false|true}] node-name

DESCRIPTION
       The ping-node-dcom subcommand tests if a node that is enabled for
       communication over the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) remote
       protocol is usable. The DCOM protocol is available only on Windows
       systems. This subcommand requires DCOM to be configured on the machine
       where the domain administration server (DAS) is running and on the
       machine where the node resides. You may run this command from any
       machine that can contact the DAS.

       If the node is usable, the subcommand displays a confirmation that the
       subcommand could connect to the node through DCOM. This confirmation
       includes the name of the host that the node represents.

       Optionally, the subcommand can also validate the node to determine if
       the asadmin(1M) utility can run on the host that the node represents.
       To validate a node, the subcommand runs the version(1) subcommand. If
       the node is valid, the subcommand displays the version that the version
       subcommand returns.

       The node that is specified as the operand of this subcommand must be
       enabled for communication over DCOM. If the node is not enabled for
       communication over DCOM, an error occurs. To determine whether a node
       is enabled for communication over DCOM, use the list-nodes(1)
       subcommand.

           |           To test whether a node that  |
           |           is enabled for communication |
           |           over secure shell (SSH) is   |
           |           usable, use the              |
           |           ping-node-ssh(1) subcommand. |
           +----------------------------------------+

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --validate
           Specifies whether the subcommand validates the node.

           Possible values are as follows:

           true
               The node is validated.

           false
               The node is not validated (default).

OPERANDS
       node-name
           The name of the node to test. The node must be enabled for
           communication over DCOM. Otherwise, an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Testing if a DCOM-Enabled Node Is Usable
           This example tests if the DCOM-enabled node wpmd2 is usable.

               asadmin> ping-node-dcom wpmdl2
               Successfully made DCOM connection to node wpmdl2 (wpmdl2.example.com)
               Command ping-node-dcom executed successfully.

       Example 2, Validating a DCOM-Enabled Node
           This example validates the DCOM-enabled node adc-node.

               asadmin> ping-node-dcom --validate=true adc-node
               Successfully made DCOM connection to node adc-node (adc-node.example.com)
