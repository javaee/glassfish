NAME
     delete-jvm-options - removes one or  more  options  for  the
     Java application launcher

SYNOPSIS
     delete-jvm-options [--help] [--target target] [--profiler={true|false}]
     (jvm_option_name[=jvm_option_value]) [:jvm_option_name[=jvm_option_name]]*

DESCRIPTION
     The  delete-jvm-options  subcommand  removes  one  or   more
     command-line  options  for  the JavaTM application launcher.
     These options are removed from the Java configuration  java-
     config  element  or  the  profiler  profiler  element of the
     domain.xml  file.  To  see  the  Java  application  launcher
     options  that  can  be  deleted, use the list-jvm-options(1)
     subcommand.

     The deletion of some options requires a server  restart  for
     changes  to  become effective. Other options are set immedi-
     ately in the environment of the domain administration server
     (DAS) and do not require a restart.

     Whether a restart is required depends on the type of option.

         o    Restart is not required for Java system  properties
              whose  names  do not start with -Djava. or -Djavax.
              (including the trailing period). For example,  res-
              tart  is not required for the following Java system
              property:

              -Denvironment=Production

         o    Restart is required for the following options:

             o    Java system properties whose names  start  with
                  -Djava.  or  -Djavax.  (including  the trailing
                  period). For example:

                  -Djava.security.manager

             o    Startup parameters  for  the  Java  application
                  launcher. For example:

                  -client

                  -Xmx1024m

                  -d64

asadmin Utility Subcommands                 delete-jvm-options(1)

      To restart the DAS, use the restart-domain(1) command.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --profiler

         Indicates whether the Java application launcher  options
         are  for the profiler. The option must have been set for
         a profiler for this option to be true.

OPERANDS
     jvm_option_name
         One or more options delimited by a colon (:). The format
         of the operand depends on the following:

             o    If the option has a name and a value, the  for-
                  mat is option-name=value.

             o    If the option has only a name,  the  format  is
                  option_name. For example, -Xmx2048m.

         Note -

           If an option name or option value  contains  a  colon,
           the  backslash  (\fR) must be used to escape the colon
           in the name or  value.  Other  characters  might  also
           require  an  escape  character.  For  more information
           about escape characters in subcommand options, see the
           asadmin(1M) man page.
