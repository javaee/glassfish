NAME
     delete-jvm-options - removes options from  the  Java  confi-
     guration or profiler elements of the domain.xml file

SYNOPSIS
     delete-jvm-options
     [--help]
     [ --target  target]
     [--profiler={true|false}] (jvm_option_name[=jvm_option_value])
     [:jvm_option_name[=jvm_option_name]]*

DESCRIPTION
     The  delete-jvm-options  subcommand   removes   command-line
     options for the Java application launcher. These options are
     removed from the Java configuration element or profiler ele-
     ment of the domain.xml file.

     Note -

       In  the  syntax,  there  can  be  more  than  one  option,
       separated by a colon.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

     The  delete-jvm-options  subcommand  deletes  the  following
     options:

         o    Java system properties. System properties  are  set
              through  the  -D  option  of  the  Java application
              launcher, for example:

             o    -Djava.security.manager

             o    -Denvironment=Production

         o    Startup parameters for the Virtual Machine for  the
              Java   platform   (Java   Virtual  Machine  or  JVM
              machine).

         The terms "Java Virtual Machine" and "JVM" mean  a  Vir-
         tual  Machine  for  the Java platform.Startup parameters
         are preceded by the dash character (-) , for example:

             o    --XX:PermSize=size

             o    -Xmx1024m

             o    -client

             o    -d64

     In the following situations, you must terminate the  command
     with a double-dash (--) before the options:

         o    You are specifying only one  system  property  with
              just   a   name   and   no   value,   for  example,
              -Djava.security.manager.

         o    You are specifying a startup parameter for the  JVM
              machine without a value, for example, -Xmx1024m

     The removal of some options requires a restart of the domain
     administration  server  (DAS)  to  become  effective.  Other
     options become immediately unavailable in the environment of
     the DAS and do not require a restart.

     Whether a restart is required depends on  the  type  of  the
     option.

         o    Restart is not required for Java system  properties
              whose  names  do not start with -Djava. or -Djavax.
              (including the trailing period). For example,  res-
              tart  is  not required for the Java system property
              -Denvironment=Production.

         o    Restart is required for the following options:

             o    System  properties  whose  names   start   with
                  -Djava.  or  -Djavax.  (including  the trailing
                  period), for example, -Djava.security.manager

             o    Startup parameters for  the  JVM  machine,  for
                  example, -Xmx1024m, -client or -d64

      To restart the DAS, use the restart-domain(1) command.

     see the reference page for the operating system that you are
     using:

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --profiler

         Indicates whether the JVM options are for the  profiler.
         The profiler must exist for this option to be true.

OPERANDS
     jvm_option_name=jvm_option_value
         the left side of the equal sign (=) is  the  JVM  option
         name.  The  right  side of the equal sign (=) is the JVM
         option value. A colon (:) is a  delimiter  for  multiple
         options.

         Note -

           If an option name or option value  contains  a  colon,
           the  backslash  (\fR) must be used to escape the colon
           in the name or  value.  Other  characters  might  also
           require  an  escape  character.  For  more information
           about escape characters in command  options,  see  the
           asadmin(1M) man page.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Deleting JVM Options

     To remove more than one JVM  option,  use  a  colon  (:)  to
     separate  the  options.  If the JVM option itself contains a
     colon (:), use the backslash (\fR) to offset the  colon  (:)
     delimiter.
