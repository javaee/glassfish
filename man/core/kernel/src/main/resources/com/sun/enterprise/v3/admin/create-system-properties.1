NAME
     create-system-properties - adds one or more system  property
     elements  that can be referenced elsewhere in the configura-
     tion.

SYNOPSIS
     create-system-properties [--help]
     [--target target-name]
     [name=value)[:name=value]*]

DESCRIPTION
     The create-system-properties subcommand adds or updates sys-
     tem  properties  that  can  be  referenced  elsewhere on the
     server.

     GlassFish Server provides hooks where tokens (system proper-
     ties)  can  be  specified. Because GlassFish Server does not
     have multiple server elements, you can specify a  particular
     token at any level. When a domain supports multiple servers,
     the override potential can be exploited. When  a  domain  is
     started  or  restarted,  all  <system-property> elements are
     resolved and available to the Java Virtual Machine by  using
     the System.setProperty() call on each of them (with its name
     and value derived from the corresponding attributes  of  the
     element).  This  is  analogous to sending the elements as -D
     parameters on the Java command line.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         This option specifies the target on which you are creat-
         ing  the  system  properties. The valid targets for this
         subcommand are instance, cluster, configuration, domain,
         and server. Server is the default option.

OPERANDS
     name=value

         The name value pairs of the system properties to add  to
         the specified target. Multiple system properties must be
         separated by a : (colon). If a : (colon) appears in  the
         name  or  value of a system property, it must be escaped
