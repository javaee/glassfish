NAME
     rotate-log - rotates the log file

SYNOPSIS
     rotate-log [--help]

DESCRIPTION
     The rotate-log subcommand rotates the server log by renaming
     the   file   with   a   timestamp   name   in   the   format
     server.log_date-and-time,  and  creating  a  new  log  file.
     Changes  take effect dynamically, that is, server restart is
     not required.

     The size of  the  log  queue  is  configurable  through  the
     logging.properties  file. Log rotation is based on file size
     or elapsed time since the last log rotation.  In  some  cir-
     cumstances,  the  queue might fill up, especially if the log
     level is set to FINEST and there is heavy  activity  on  the
     server.  In this case, the rotate-log subcommand can be used
     to rotate the server log  immediately.  This  subcommand  is
     also useful in creating scripts for rotating the log at con-
     venient times.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
