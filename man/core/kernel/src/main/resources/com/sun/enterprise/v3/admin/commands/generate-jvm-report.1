NAME
     generate-jvm-report - shows the JVM machine statistics for a
     given target instance

SYNOPSIS
     generate-jvm-report [--help] [--type=jvm-statistic-type] [--target target]

DESCRIPTION
     The generate-jvm-report subcommand  creates  a  report  that
     shows the threads (dump of stack trace), classes, memory, or
     loggers for a given target instance,  including  the  domain
     administration  server  (DAS). If a type is not specified, a
     summary report is generated. This subcommand  only  provides
     statistics for the GlassFish Server instance processes. This
     subcommand provides an alternative to sending Ctrl+Break  or
     kill  -3  signals  to GlassFish Server processes to obtain a
     stack trace for processes that are hanging.

     The information in the report is obtained from managed beans
     (MBeans) and MXBeans that are provided in the Java Platform,
     Standard Edition (Java SE ) or  JDKTM  software  with  which
     GlassFish Server is being used.

     If GlassFish Server is running in the Java Runtime  Environ-
     ment (JRETM) software from JDK release 6 or Java SE 6, addi-
     tional information is provided. For example:

         o    System load on the available processors

         o    Object  monitors  that  are   currently   held   or
              requested by a thread

         o    Lock objects that a thread is holding, for example,
              ReentrantLock  objects  and  ReentrantReadWriteLock
              objects

     If the JRE software cannot  provide  this  information,  the
     report contains the text NOT_AVAILABLE.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --type
         The type of report that is to be generated.  Default  is
         summary.

         summary

             Displays  summary  information  about  the  threads,
             classes, and memory (default).

         memory
             Provides information about heap and non-heap  memory
             consumption,  memory  pools,  and garbage collection
             statistics for a given target instance.

         class

             Provides information about the class  loader  for  a
             given target instance.

         thread
             Provides information about threads running  and  the
             thread   dump  (stack  trace)  for  a  given  target
             instance.

         log

             Provides information  about  the  loggers  that  are
             registered in the Virtual Machine TMr the Java plat-
             form (Java Virtual Machine or  JVM   machine).

             The terms "Java Virtual Machine" and  "JVM"  mean  a
             Virtual Machine for the Java platform.

     This example shows a partial listing of  a  report  that  is
     generated  if no type is specified. This same report is gen-
     erated if the summary type is specified.
