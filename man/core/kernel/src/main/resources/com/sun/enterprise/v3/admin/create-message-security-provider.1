NAME
     create-message-security-provider  -  enables  administrators
     to  create  a message security provider, which specifies how
     SOAP messages will be secured.

     [--responseauthsource response_auth_source ]

DESCRIPTION
     The create-message-security-provider subcommand enables  the
     administrator  to create a message security provider for the
     security service which specifies how SOAP messages  will  be
     secured.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     If an option has a short option name, then the short  option
     precedes  the  long option name. Short options have one dash
     whereas long options have two dashes.

     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --classname

         Defines the Java implementation class of  the  provider.
         Client   authentication  providers  must  implement  the
         com.sun.enterprise.      security.jauth.ClientAuthModule
         interface.  Server-side  providers  must  implement  the
         com.sun.enterprise.security       jauth.ServerAuthModule

         interface. A provider may implement both interfaces, but
         it must implement the  interface  corresponding  to  its
         provider type.

     --layer

         The message-layer entity used to define the value of the
         auth-layer  attribute  of  message-security-config  ele-
         ments. The default is  HttpServlet.  Another  option  is
         SOAP.

     --providertype
         Establishes whether the provider is to be used as client
         authentication provider, server authentication provider,
         or both. Valid options for this property include client,
         server, or client-server.

     --requestauthsource

         The auth-source  attribute  defines  a  requirement  for
         message-layer sender authentication (e.g. username pass-
         word) or content authentication (e.g. digital signature)
         to  be  applied to request messages. Possible values are
         sender or content. When this argument is not  specified,
         source authentication of the request is not required.

     --requestauthrecipient
         The auth-recipient attribute defines a  requirement  for
         message-layer  authentication  of the receiver of a mes-
         sage to its sender (e.g. by  XML  encryption).  Possible
         values  are before-content or after-content. The default
         value is after-content.

     --responseauthsource

         The auth-source  attribute  defines  a  requirement  for
         message-layer sender authentication (e.g. username pass-
         word) or content authentication (e.g. digital signature)
         to  be applied to response messages. Possible values are
         sender or content. When this option  is  not  specified,
         source authentication of the response is not required.

     --responseauthrecipient
         The auth-recipient attribute defines a  requirement  for
         message-layer  authentication  of  the  receiver  of the
         response message to its sender (e.g. by XML encryption).

         Possible values are before-content or after-content. The
         default value is after-content.

     --isdefaultprovider

         The default-provider attribute is used to designate  the
         provider  as  the default provider (at the layer) of the
         type or types identified by the  providertype  argument.
         There is no default associated with this option.

     --property
         Use this property  to  pass  provider-specific  property
         values  to  the provider when it is initialized. Proper-
         ties passed in this way might include key aliases to  be
         used  by  the provider to get keys from keystores, sign-
         ing, canonicalization, encryption algorithms, etc.

         The following properties may be set:

         security.config

             Specifies the location of the message security  con-
             figuration file. To point to a configuration file in
             the domain-dir/config directory, use the system pro-
             perty ${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/config/, for exam-
             ple:  ${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/config/wss-server-
             config-1.0.xml.  The  default  is domain-dir/config/
             wss-serverconfig-1.0.xml.

         debug
             If true, enables dumping of  server  provider  debug
             messages to the server log. The default is false.

         dynamic.username. password

             If true, signals the provider runtime to collect the
             user  name and password from the CallbackHandler for
             each request. If false, the user name  and  password
             for  wsse:UsernameToken(s) is collected once, during
             module initialization. This property is only  appli-
             cable for a ClientAuthModule. The default is false.

         encryption.key.alias
             Specifies the encryption key used by  the  provider.
             The  key  is  identified  by its keystore alias. The
             default value is s1as.

         signature.key.alias

             Specifies the signature key used  by  the  provider.
             The  key  is  identified  by its keystore alias. The
             default value is s1as.

OPERANDS
     provider_name
         The  name  of  the  provider  used  to   reference   the
         provider-config element.
