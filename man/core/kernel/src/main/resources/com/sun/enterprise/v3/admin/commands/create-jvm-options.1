NAME
     create-jvm-options - creates options for the  Java  applica-
     tion launcher

SYNOPSIS
     create-jvm-options [--help] [--target target] [--profiler={true|false}]
     (jvm_option_name=jvm_option_value) [:jvm_option_name=jvm_option_value*]

DESCRIPTION
     The  create-jvm-options  subcommand   creates   command-line
     options  that  are  passed  to the Java application launcher
     when Enterprise Server is started.  The  options  that  this
     subcommand  creates  are in addition to the options that are
     preset with Enterprise  Server.  Java  application  launcher
     options  are  stored  in  the Java configuration java-config
     element or the profiler profiler element of  the  domain.xml
     file.  The options are sent to the command line in the order
     they appear in the java-config element or the profiler  pro-
     filer element in the domain.xml file.

     Profiler options are used to record the  settings  that  are
     required  to  start a particular profiler. The profiler must
     already exist. If necessary, use the create-profiler(1) sub-
     command to create the profiler.

     This subcommand can be used to create the following types of
     options:

         o    Java  system  properties.  These  options  are  set
              through  the  -D  option  of  the  Java application
              launcher. For example:

              -Djava.security.manager

              -Denvironment=Production

         o    Startup  parameters  for   the   Java   application
              launcher.  These  options  are preceded by the dash
              character (-). For example:

              --XX:PermSize=size

              -Xmx1024m

              -d64

     If the subcommand specifies an option that  already  exists,
     the command does not re-create the option.

     Note -

       Ensure that any option that you create is valid. The  sub-
       command  might  allow you to create an invalid option, but
       such an invalid option can cause startup to fail.

     An option can be verified by examining the server log  after
     Enterprise  Server  starts. Options for the Java application
     launcher are written to the server.log file before any other
     information when Enterprise Server starts.

     The addition of some options requires a server  restart  for
     changes  to  become effective. Other options are set immedi-
     ately in the environment of the domain administration server
     (DAS)  and  do  not  require a restart. Whether a restart is
     required depends on the type of option.

         o    Restart is not required for Java system  properties
              whose  names  do not start with -Djava. or -Djavax.
              (including the trailing period). For example,  res-
              tart  is not required for the following Java system
              property:

              -Denvironment=Production

         o    Restart is required for the following options:

             o    Java system properties whose names  start  with
                  -Djava.  or  -Djavax.  (including  the trailing
                  period). For example:

                  -Djava.security.manager

             o    Startup parameters  for  the  Java  application
                  launcher. For example:

                  -client

                  -Xmx1024m

                  -d64

      To restart the DAS, use the restart-domain(1) command.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS

asadmin Utility Subcommands                 create-jvm-options(1)

     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --profiler

         Indicates whether the Java application launcher  options
         are  for  the profiler. The profiler must exist for this
         option to be true. Default is false.

OPERANDS
     jvm_option_name
         One or more options delimited by a colon (:). The format
         of an option depends on the following:

             o    If the option has a name and a value, the  for-
                  mat is option-name=value.

             o    If the option has only a name,  the  format  is
                  option_name. For example, -Xmx2048m.

         Note -

           If an option name or option value  contains  a  colon,
           the  backslash  (\fR) must be used to escape the colon
           in the name or  value.  Other  characters  might  also
           require  an  escape  character.  For  more information
           about escape characters in subcommand options, see the
           asadmin(1M) man page.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Setting Java System Properties

     This example sets multiple Java system properties.

       asadmin> create-jvm-options -Dunixlocation=/root/example:
       -Dvariable=OME:-Dwindowslocation=d:\sun\appserver:-Doption1=-value1
       created 4 option(s)

asadmin Utility Subcommands                 create-jvm-options(1)

       Command create-jvm-options executed successfully.

     Example 2 Setting a Startup Parameter for the Java  Applica-
     tion Launcher

     This example sets the maximum available heap size to 1024.

       asadmin> create-jvm-options -Xmx1024m
       created 1 option(s)
       Command create-jvm-options executed successfully.

     Example 3 Setting Multiple Startup Parameters for  the  Java
     Application Launcher

     This example sets the maximum available heap  size  to  1024
     and requests details about garbage collection.

       asadmin> create-jvm-options "-Xmx1024m:-XX:+PrintGCDetails"
       created 1 option(s)
       Command create-jvm-options executed successfully.

     In this case, one of the two parameters already  exists,  so
     the subcommand reports that only one option was set.

     Example 4 Setting a JVM Startup Parameter for the Profiler

     This example sets a JVM startup parameter for the profiler.

       asadmin> create-jvm-options --profiler=true -XX:MaxPermSize=192m
       created 1 option(s)
       Command create-jvm-options executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
