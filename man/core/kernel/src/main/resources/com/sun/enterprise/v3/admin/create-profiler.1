asadmin Utility Subcommands                    create-profiler(1)

NAME
     create-profiler - creates the profiler element

SYNOPSIS
     create-profiler [--help] [--target target_name]
     [--classpath classpath] [--nativelibpath native_library_path] [--enabled=true]
     [--property(name=value)[:name=value]*] profiler_name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-profiler subcommand creates the profiler element.
     A  server  instance  is tied to the profiler by the profiler
     element in the Java configuration. Only one profiler  exists
     at  a  time.  If  you attempt to create a profiler while one
     already exists, an error message is displayed.

     For changes to take effect, the server must restarted.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --classpath

         Java classpath string that specifies the classes  needed
         by the profiler.

     --nativelibpath
         This path is automatically constructed to be a  concate-
         nation  of  the Application Server installation relative
         path for  its  native  shared  libraries,  standard  JRE
         native  library  path,  the  shell  environment  setting
         (LD_LIBRARY_PATH on UNIX)  and  any  path  that  may  be
         specified in the profile element.
