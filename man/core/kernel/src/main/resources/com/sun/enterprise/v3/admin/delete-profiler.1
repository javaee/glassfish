NAME
     delete-profiler - removes the profiler element

SYNOPSIS
     delete-profiler [--help] [--target target_name]

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-profiler subcommand deletes the profiler  element
     in  the Java configuration. Only one profiler can exist at a
     time. If you attempt to create a profiler while one  already
     exists,  an error message is displayed and the existing pro-
     filer must be deleted.

     For changes to take effect, the server must restarted.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command runs successfully and the option is ignored.
