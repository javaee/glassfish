NAME
     list-system-properties - lists the system properties of  the
     domain, configuration, cluster, or server instance

SYNOPSIS
     list-system-properties [--help] [target]

DESCRIPTION
     Shared or clustered server  instances  will  often  need  to
     override  attributes  defined in their referenced configura-
     tion. Any configuration attribute in a server  instance  can
     be overridden through a system property of the corresponding
     name. The list-system-properties subcommand lists the system
     properties  of  a  domain, configuration, cluster, or server
     instance.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
