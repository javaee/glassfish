DESCRIPTION
     The delete-ssl subcommand deletes the  SSL  element  in  the
     selected HTTP listener, IIOP listener, or IIOP service.

     The listener_id is not  required  if  the  --type  is  iiop-
     service.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     If an option has a short option name, then the short  option
     precedes  the  long option name. Short options have one dash
     whereas long options have two dashes.

     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

      --type

         The type of service or listener for  which  the  SSL  is
         deleted. The type must be one of the following types:

             o    http-listener

             o    iiop-listener

             o    iiop-service
