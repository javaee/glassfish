NAME
     create-threadpool - adds a thread pool

SYNOPSIS
     create-threadpool [--help] [--target target_name]
     [--maxthreadpoolsize maxthreadpoolsize]
     [--minthreadpoolsize minthreadpoolsize]
     [--idletimeout idletimeout] [--maxqueuesize maxqueuesize]
     [--workqueues workqueues] threadpool_id

DESCRIPTION
     The create-threadpool subcommand creates a thread pool  with
     the  specified  name.  You  can  specify maximum and minimum
     number of threads in the pool, the quantity of messages, and
     the idle timeout of a thread. The created thread pool can be
     used for servicing IIOP requests and for  resource  adapters
     to  service  work  management requests. A thread pool can be
     used in multiple resource adapters.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

         ignored.
