NAME
     create-threadpool - adds a thread pool

SYNOPSIS
     create-threadpool [--help] [--target target_name] [--maxthreadpoolsize max_threadpool_size]
     [--minthreadpoolsize min_threadpool_size] [--idletimeout idletimeout-in-seconds]
     [--workqueues number_work_queues] threadpool_id

DESCRIPTION
     The create-threadpool subcommand creates a thread pool  with
     the  specified  name.  You  can  specify maximum and minimum
     number of threads in the pool, the quantity of work  queues,
     and  the  idle  timeout of a thread. The created thread pool
     can be used for servicing IIOP  requests  and  for  resource
     adapters  to service work management requests. A thread pool
     can be used in multiple resource adapters.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --maxthreadpoolsize

         Specifies the maximum number of  threads  the  pool  can
         contain. Default is 5.

     --minthreadpoolsize
         Specifies the minimum number of  threads  in  the  pool.
         These  are created when the thread pool is instantiated.
         Default is 2.

     --idletimeout

         Specifies the amount of time in seconds after which idle
         threads are removed from the pool. Default is 900.
