NAME
     validate-multicast - validates that multicast  transport  is
     available for clusters

SYNOPSIS
     validate-multicast [--help] [--multicastport multicastport]
     [--multicastaddress multicastaddress]
     [--bindinterface bindinterface]
     [--sendperiod sendperiod]
     [--timeout timeout]
     [--timetolive timetolive]
     [--verbose={false|true}]

DESCRIPTION
     The validate-multicast subcommand validates  that  multicast
     transport is available for clusters.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --multicastport
         The port for the multicast socket  on  which  the  Group
         Management  Service  (GMS)  listens  for  group  events.
         Specify a standard UDP port number in  the  range  2048-
         32000. The default is 2048.

     --multicastaddress

         The address for the multicast socket on  which  the  GMS
         listens  for group events. Specify a class D IP address.
         Class D IP addresses  are  in  the  range  224.0.0.0  to
         239.255.255.255,  inclusive.  The  address  224.0.0.0 is
         reserved  and  should  not  be  used.  The  default   is
         228.9.3.1.

     --bindinterface
         The local interface to receive multicast datagram  pack-
         ets  for  the  GMS.  The default is null, which uses all
         available binding interfaces.

         On a multi-home machine (possessing two or more  network
         interfaces),  this  attribute  enables  you  to indicate
         which network interface is used for the GMS. This  value
         must be a local network interface IP address.

     --sendperiod

         The number of milliseconds between  test  messages  sent
         between nodes. The default is 2000.

     --timeout
         The number of seconds before the  subcommand  times  out
         and  exits.  The  default  is 20. You can also exit this
         subcommand using Ctrl-C.

     --timetolive

         The default time-to-live for multicast packets sent  out
         on the multicast socket in order to control the scope of
         the multicasts. The time-to-live value must  be  between
         zero  and  255 inclusive. The default is the JDK default
         or a minimum defined by a constant in the GMS subsystem,
         whichever  is lower. To see the time-to-live value being
         used, use the --verbose option.

     --verbose
         If used without a value or set to true,  provides  addi-
         tional debugging information. The default is false.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Validating multicast transport

       asadmin> validate-multicast --timeout 3
       Timeout set to 3 seconds
       Will use port 2,048
       Will use address 228.9.3.1
       Will use bind interface null
       Will use wait period 2,000 (in milliseconds)

       Listening for data...
       Sending message with content "hostname.local" every 2,000 milliseconds
       Received data from hostname.local (loopback)
       Exiting after 3 seconds. To change this timeout, use the --timeout command line option.
       Received no data (ignoring loopback messages)
       Command validate-multicast executed successfully

EXIT STATUS
     0                   command executed successfully
