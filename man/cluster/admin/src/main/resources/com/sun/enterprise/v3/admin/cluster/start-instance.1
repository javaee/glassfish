NAME
     start-instance - starts a GlassFish Server instance

SYNOPSIS
     start-instance [--help]
     [--debug={false|true}] [--sync={normal|full|none}]
     instance-name

DESCRIPTION
     The start-instance  subcommand  starts  a  GlassFish  Server
     instance.  This subcommand requires secure shell (SSH) to be
     configured on the machine where  the  domain  administration
     server  (DAS)  is  running  and  on  the  machine  where the
     instance resides. You  may  run  this  subcommand  from  any
     machine that can contact the DAS.

     The subcommand can  start  any  GlassFish  Server  instance,
     regardless  of  how  the  instance was created. For example,
     this subcommand can start an instance that  was  created  by
     using the create-local-instance(1) subcommand.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --debug
         Specifies whether the  instance  is  started  with  Java
         Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) debugging enabled.

         Possible values are as follows:

         true

             The instance is started with JPDA debugging  enabled
             and the port number for JPDA debugging is displayed.

         false
             The instance is started with JPDA debugging disabled
             (default).

     --sync

         The type of synchronization  between  the  DAS  and  the
         instance's files when the instance is started.

         Possible values are as follows:

         none
             The DAS does not synchronize  the  instance's  files
             with  any  changes.  This  type  of  synchronization
             minimizes the time that is  required  to  start  the
             instance.

         normal

             The DAS synchronizes the instance only with  changes
             since  the  last  synchronization  to  the following
             files:

                 o    All changes in the config directory

                 o    Changes to files only in the top  level  of
                      the  applications directory and the docroot
                      directory

                      If a file below this level is changed, full
                      synchronization   is  required.  In  normal
                      operation, files below  the  top  level  of
                      these  directories  are  not changed. If an
                      application  is  deployed  and  undeployed,
                      full  synchronization  is  not necessary to
                      update the instance with the change.
             This value is the default.

         full
             The DAS synchronizes the instance with  all  changes
             since  the  last  synchronization. This type of syn-
             chronization might delay the startup of the instance
             while  the  DAS  updates all files in the instance's
             directories.

OPERANDS
     instance-name

         The name of the GlassFish Server instance to start.
