NAME
     restart-instance  -  restarts  a  running  GlassFish  Server
     instance

SYNOPSIS
     restart-instance [--help]
     [--debug={false|true}] instance-name

DESCRIPTION
     The restart-instance subcommand restarts a running GlassFish
     Server instance. This subcommand requires secure shell (SSH)
     to be configured on the machine where the domain administra-
     tion  server  (DAS)  is running and on the machine where the
     instance resides. You  may  run  this  subcommand  from  any
     machine that can contact the DAS.

     The subcommand can restart any  GlassFish  Server  instance,
     regardless  of  how  the  instance was created. For example,
     this subcommand can restart an instance that was created  by
     using the create-local-instance(1) subcommand.

     When this subcommand restarts an instance, the DAS synchron-
     izes the instance only with changes since the last synchron-
     ization to the following files:

         o    All changes in the config directory

         o    Changes to files only  in  the  top  level  of  the
              applications directory and the docroot directory

              If a file below this level is  changed,  full  syn-
              chronization  is  required.  In  normal  operation,
              files below the top level of these directories  are
              not  changed.  If  an  application  is deployed and
              undeployed, full synchronization is  not  necessary
              to update the instance with the change.

     If  different  synchronization  behavior  is  required,  the
     instance  must  be  stopped and restarted by using following
     sequence of subcommands:

         1.   stop-instance(1)

         2.   start-instance(1)

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --debug
         Specifies whether the instance is  restarted  with  Java
         Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) debugging enabled.

         Possible values are as follows:

         true

             The  instance  is  restarted  with  JPDA   debugging
             enabled  and  the  port number for JPDA debugging is
             displayed.

         false
             The instance is restarted with JPDA  debugging  dis-
             abled.

         The default is the current setting of  this  option  for
         the instance that is being restarted.

OPERANDS
     instance-name

         The name of the GlassFish Server instance to restart. If
         the  instance  is not running, the subcommand displays a
         warning message and attempts to start the instance.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Restarting a GlassFish Server Instance

     This example restarts the GlassFish Server instance pmdsa1.

       asadmin> restart-instance pmdsa1
       Instance pmdsa1 was restarted.

       Command restart-instance executed successfully.
