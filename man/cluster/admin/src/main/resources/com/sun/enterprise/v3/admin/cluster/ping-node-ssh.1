NAME
     ping-node-ssh - tests if a node that is enabled for communi-
     cation over SSH is usable

SYNOPSIS
     ping-node-ssh [--help]
     [--validate={false|true}] node-name

DESCRIPTION
     The ping-node-ssh subcommand tests if a node that is enabled
     for  communication  over  secure shell (SSH) is usable. This
     subcommand requires secure shell (SSH) to be  configured  on
     the  machine where the domain administration server (DAS) is
     running and on the machine where the node resides.  You  may
     run this command from any machine that can contact the DAS.

     The node that is specified as the operand of this subcommand
     must  be  enabled for communication over SSH. If the node is
     not enabled for communication over SSH, an error occurs.  To
     determine  whether  a node is enabled for communication over
     SSH, use the list-nodes(1) subcommand.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --validate
         Specifies whether validation of the node is performed.

         Possible values are as follows:

         true

             Validation is performed.

         false
             No validation is performed (default).

OPERANDS
     node-name

         The name of the node to test. The node must  be  enabled
