DESCRIPTION
     The create-instance subcommand creates  a  GlassFish  Server
     instance.  This subcommand requires secure shell (SSH) to be
     configured on the machine where  the  domain  administration
     server  (DAS)  is  running  and  on  the  machine  where the
     instance is to reside. You may run  this  command  from  any
     machine that can contact the DAS.

     A GlassFish Server instance is a single Virtual Machine  for
     the Java platform (Java Virtual Machine or JVM machine) on a
     single node in which GlassFish Server  is  running.  A  node
     defines  the  machine  where  the  GlassFish Server instance
     resides. The JVM machine must be compatible  with  the  Java
     Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE).

     A GlassFish Server instance requires a reference to the fol-
     lowing items:

         o    The  node  that  defines  the  machine  where   the
              instance resides. The node must be specified in the
              command to create the instance.

         o    The named configuration that defines the configura-
              tion  of  the  instance.  The  configuration can be
              specified in the command to  create  the  instance,
              but  is not required. If no configuration is speci-
              fied for an instance that is not joining a cluster,
              the  subcommand  creates  a  configuration  for the
              instance. An instance that  is  joining  a  cluster
              receives its configuration from its parent cluster.

     Each GlassFish Server instance is one of the following types
     of instance:

     Standalone instance

         A standalone instance does not share  its  configuration
         with  any  other  instances  or  clusters.  A standalone

         instance is created if no configuration  or  cluster  is
         specified in the command to create the instance.

         When a standalone instance is created,  a  copy  of  the
         default-config   configuration   is   created   for  the
         instance. The name of this  configuration  is  instance-
         name-config,  where instance-name represents the name of
         an unclustered server instance.

     Shared instance

         A shared instance shares its  configuration  with  other
         instances or clusters. A shared instance is created if a
         named configuration  is  specified  in  the  command  to
         create the instance.

     Clustered instance
         A clustered instance inherits its configuration from the
         cluster  to  which  the  instance belongs and shares its
         configuration with other instances  in  the  cluster.  A
         clustered  instance is created if a cluster is specified
         in the command to create the instance.

         Any instance that is not part of a cluster is considered
         an  unclustered  server  instance. Therefore, standalone
         instances and shared instances  are  unclustered  server
         instances.

     By default, this subcommand  attempts  to  resolve  possible
     port  conflicts  for the instance that is being created. The
     subcommand also assigns ports that are currently not in  use
     and  not  already  assigned  to  other instances on the same
     node. The subcommand assigns these ports randomly.  Use  the
     --systemproperties  option  to  resolve  port  conflicts for
     additional instances on the same node. System properties  of
     an  instance  can be manipulated by using the create-system-
     properties(1) subcommand and  the  delete-system-property(1)
     subcommand.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

     --node

         The name of the node that defines the machine where  the
         instance  is to be created. The node must already exist.
         If the instance is to be created on  the  machine  where
         the  domain  administration server (DAS) is running, use
         the predefined node localhost.

     --config
         Specifies the  named  configuration  that  the  instance
         references. The configuration must exist and must not be
         named default-config or server-config. If the configura-
         tion name specifies a standalone configuration, an error
         occurs. Specifying the --config option creates a  shared
         instance.

         The --config option and the --cluster option  are  mutu-
         ally  exclusive.  If  both  options are omitted, a stan-
         dalone instance is created.

     --cluster

         Specifies the cluster from which the  instance  inherits
         its   configuration.  Specifying  the  --cluster  option
         creates a clustered instance.

         The --config option and the --cluster option  are  mutu-
         ally  exclusive.  If  both  options are omitted, a stan-
         dalone instance is created.

     --lbenabled
         Specifies whether  the  instance  is  enabled  for  load
         balancing. Possible values are as follows:

         true

             The  instance  is   enabled   for   load   balancing
             (default).

             When an instance is enabled for  load  balancing,  a
             load balancer sends requests to the instance.

         false
             The instance is disabled for load balancing.

             When an instance is disabled for load  balancing,  a
             load   balancer   does  not  send  requests  to  the
             instance.

     --portbase

         Determines the number with  which  the  port  assignment
         should start. An instance uses a certain number of ports
         that are statically assigned. The portbase value  deter-
         mines  where the assignment should start. The values for
         the ports are calculated as follows:

             o    Administration port: portbase + 48

             o    HTTP listener port: portbase + 80

             o    IIOP listener port: portbase + 37

             o    JMX port: portbase + 86
         When the --portbase option is specified, the  output  of
         this subcommand includes a complete list of used ports.

     --checkports
         Specifies whether to check for the availability  of  the
         administration,  HTTP,  JMS,  JMX,  and  IIOP ports. The
         default value is true.

     --systemproperties

         Defines system properties for the instance.  These  pro-
         perties  override property definitions for port settings
         in the instance's configuration.  Predefined  port  set-
         tings  must be overridden if, for example, two clustered
         instances reside on the same machine. In this situation,
         port  settings  for  one  instance  must  be  overridden
         because both instances share the same configuration.

         The following properties are available:

         ASADMIN_LISTENER_PORT
             This property specifies the port number of the  HTTP
             port or the HTTPS port for administration. This port
             is the port in the URL that you specify in your  web
             browser   to   manage  the  instance,  for  example,
             http://localhost:4949. Valid values are 1-65535.  On
             UNIX,  creating  sockets that listen on ports 1-1024
             requires superuser privileges.

         HTTP_LISTENER_PORT

             This property specifies the port number of the  port
             that  is  used  to  listen  for HTTP requests. Valid
             values are 1-65535. On UNIX, creating  sockets  that

             privileges.

         HTTP_SSL_LISTENER_PORT

             This property specifies the port number of the  port
             that  is  used  to listen for HTTPS requests.  Valid
             values are 1-65535. On UNIX, creating  sockets  that
             listen    on   ports   1-1024   requires   superuser
             privileges.

         IIOP_LISTENER_PORT
             This property specifies the port number of the  port
             that  is used for IIOP connections. Valid values are
             1-65535. On UNIX, creating sockets  that  listen  on
             ports 1-1024 requires superuser privileges.

         IIOP_SSL_LISTENER_PORT

             This property specifies the port number of the  port
             that  is  used  for  secure  IIOP connections. Valid
             values are 1-65535. On UNIX, creating  sockets  that
             listen    on   ports   1-1024   requires   superuser
             privileges.

         IIOP_SSL_MUTUALAUTH_PORT
             This property specifies the port number of the  port
             that is used for secure IIOP connections with client
             authentication.

         JMS_PROVIDER_PORT

             This property specifies the port number for the Java
             Message  Service provider. Valid values are 1-65535.
             On UNIX,  creating  sockets  that  listen  on  ports
             1-1024 requires superuser privileges.

         JMX_SYSTEM_CONNECTOR_PORT
             This property specifies the port number on which the
             JMX  connector listens. Valid values are 1-65535. On
             UNIX, creating sockets that listen on  ports  1-1024
             requires superuser privileges.
