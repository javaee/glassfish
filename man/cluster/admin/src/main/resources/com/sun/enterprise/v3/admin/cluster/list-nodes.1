asadmin Utility Subcommands                         list-nodes(1)

NAME
     list-nodes - lists all GlassFish Server nodes in a domain

SYNOPSIS
     list-nodes [--help] [--long={false|true}]

DESCRIPTION
     The list-nodes subcommand lists all GlassFish  Server  nodes
     in a domain.

     By default, the subcommand displays the  following  informa-
     tion for each node that is listed:

         o    The name of the node

         o    The type of the node, which is one of the following
              types:

              CONFIG

                  The node does not support remote communication.

              SSH
                  The node  supports  communication  over  secure
                  shell (SSH).

         o    The name of the host that the node represents

     The --long option of the subcommand  specifies  whether  the
     nodes are listed in long format. In long format, the follow-
     ing additional information about each node is displayed:

         o    The path to the parent  of  the  base  installation
              directory  of GlassFish Server on the host that the
              node represents

         o    A comma-separated list of the names of the  GlassF-
              ish Server instances that reside on the node

     If the --terse option of the asadmin(1M) utility is true and
     the --long option of the subcommand is false, the subcommand
     lists only the name of each node.
