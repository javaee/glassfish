NAME
     export-sync-bundle - exports the  configuration  data  of  a
     cluster or standalone instance to a ZIP archive

SYNOPSIS
     export-sync-bundle [--help]
     --target target
     [--retrieve={false|true}]
     [file-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The export-sync-bundle exports the configuration data  of  a
     cluster  or  standalone  instance  to a ZIP archive. The ZIP
     archive can then be used with the import-sync-bundle(1) sub-
     command to restore the configuration data.

     The subcommand creates an archive that contains the  follow-
     ing files and directories in the current domain directory:

         o    All the files in the following directories:

             o    config

             o    docroot

         o    The entire contents of  the  following  directories
              and their  subdirectories:

             o    applications

             o    config/target, where target is the  cluster  or
                  standalone  instance  for  which  configuration
                  data is being exported

             o    generated

             o    lib

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS

         configuration  data.  The  --target  option is required.
         This option  must  not  specify  a  clustered  GlassFish
         Server  instance.  If  this option specifies a clustered
         GlassFish Server, an error occurs.

     --retrieve

         Specifies whether the ZIP archive is downloaded from the
         DAS machine to the machine where the subcommand is run.

         Possible values are as follows:

         true
             The ZIP archive is downloaded to the  machine  where
             the  subcommand  is run. If the subcommand is run on
             host where the instance resides, this option must be
             true.

         false

             The ZIP archive is not downloaded and remains on the
             DAS  machine  (default). If the subcommand is run on
             the DAS host, this option must be false.

OPERANDS
     file-name
         The file name and location of the ZIP archive  to  which
         to export the data.

         The default depends on the  setting  of  the  --retrieve
         option:

             o    If  --retrieve  is  false,   the   default   is
                  sync/target-sync-bundle.zip   in   the  current
                  domain directory.

             o    If --retrieve is true, the default  is  target-
                  sync-bundle.zip in the user's home directory.
         target is the cluster or standalone  instance  that  the
         --target option specifies.

         If a relative path is  specified,  the  ZIP  archive  is
         created in the config subdirectory of the current domain
         directory.

         If  an  existing  directory  is  specified   without   a
         filename,  the  file  name of the ZIP archive is target-
         sync-bundle.zip,  where  target  is   the   cluster   or

         standalone instance that the --target option specifies.
