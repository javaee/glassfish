asadmin Utility Subcommands                      start-cluster(1)

NAME
     start-cluster - starts a cluster

SYNOPSIS
     start-cluster [--help] [--autohadboverride={true|false}]
     [--verbose={false|true}] cluster-name

DESCRIPTION
     The start-cluster subcommand starts a  cluster  by  starting
     all  GlassFish  Server instances in the cluster that are not
     already running. This subcommand requires secure shell (SSH)
     to be configured on the machine where the domain administra-
     tion server (DAS) is  running  and  on  all  machines  where
     instances in the cluster reside. You may run this subcommand
     from any machine that can contact the DAS.

     Note -

       To start a cluster on machines where SSH  is  not  config-
       ured,  run the start-local-instance(1) subcommand for each
       instance from the machine where the instance resides.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --autohadboverride
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command runs successfully and the option is ignored.

     --verbose

         Specifies  whether  additional  status  information   is
         displayed when the cluster is started.

         Valid values are as follows:

         true
             Displays the command to start each instance  in  the
             cluster  and  whether  the  attempt  to  start  each
             instance succeeded.
