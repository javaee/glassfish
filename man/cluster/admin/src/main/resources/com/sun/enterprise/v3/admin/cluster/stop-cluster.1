NAME
     stop-cluster - stops a cluster

SYNOPSIS
     stop-cluster
     [--help]
     [ --autohadboverride={true|false} ] cluster_name

DESCRIPTION
     Note -

       This command is available only in domains that are config-
       ured to support clusters, such as domains that are created
       with the cluster profile or the  enterprise  profile.  For
       information about profiles, see Usage Profiles in Sun Java
       System Application Server 9.1 Administration Guide.

     The  stop-cluster  command  attempts  to  stop  all  running
     instances  in  the  cluster that are reachable through their
     node agent. In  other  words,  some  instances  may  not  be
     stopped  if  their  node  agent  is  not running. If HADB is
     installed, this command can  also  stop  the  HADB  database
     associated  with  a  cluster,  depending  upon the cluster's
     autohadb setting and whether  you  override  it  using  this
     command's autohadboverride option.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help

     --autohadboverride
         This option is  valid  only  if  the  HADB  software  is
         installed.   The   autohadboverride   option  determines
         whether  to  override  the  cluster's  setting  for  the
         autohadb  option.  When  the  cluster  was  created, the
         autohadb option was set to signal whether the HADB data-
         base  associated  with  the  cluster  would  be started,
         stopped,  or  deleted  when  the  cluster  was  started,
         stopped,  or  deleted. You can override this value using
         the autohadboverride option. If autohadboverride is  set
         to  true,  the HADB database is stopped when the cluster
         is stopped. If set to false, the HADB  database  is  not
         stopped  when  the  cluster  is stopped. If the autohad-
         boverride option is not set, the default is to  use  the
