NAME
     delete-instance - deletes a GlassFish Server instance

SYNOPSIS
     delete-instance [--help]  instance-name

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-instance subcommand deletes  a  GlassFish  Server
     instance.  This subcommand requires secure shell (SSH) to be
     configured on the machine where  the  domain  administration
     server  (DAS)  is  running  and  on  the  machine  where the
     instance resides. You  may  run  this  subcommand  from  any
     machine that can contact the DAS.

     The subcommand can delete  any  GlassFish  Server  instance,
     regardless  of  how  the  instance was created. For example,
     this subcommand can delete an instance that was  created  by
     using the create-local-instance(1) subcommand.

     The instance that is being deleted must not be running. Oth-
     erwise, an error occurs.

     The subcommand deletes an instance by performing the follow-
     ing actions:

         o    Removing the instance from the configuration of the
              domain administration server (DAS)

         o    Deleting the instance's files from file system

     If the instance that is being deleted is the  only  instance
     that  is  using  the  node directory, that directory is also
     removed.

     If a standalone instance is deleted,  the  instance's  stan-
     dalone  configuration is also deleted. A standalone instance
     refers to a configuration that is named instance-name-config
     to which no other clusters or unclustered instances refer.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
