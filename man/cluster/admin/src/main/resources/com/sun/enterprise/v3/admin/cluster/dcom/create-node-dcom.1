DESCRIPTION
     The create-node-dcom  subcommand  creates  a  node  that  is
     enabled  for  communication  over  the Distributed Component
     Object Model (DCOM) remote protocol. The  DCOM  protocol  is
     available only on Windows systems.

     A node represents a  host  on  which  the  GlassFish  Server
     software  is  installed. A node must exist for every host on
     which GlassFish Server instances reside.

     In a DCOM-enabled network, the domain administration  server
     (DAS)  contacts  a node's host through the DCOM connector to
     manage GlassFish Server instances that reside on  the  node.
     However,  the DAS does not use the DCOM connector to contact
     the host where the DAS is running because the  DAS  can  run
     all asadmin subcommands locally.

     By default, the subcommand fails and the node is not created
     if  the  DAS cannot contact the node's host through DCOM. To
     force the node to be created in the DAS  configuration  even
     if  the  host  cannot  be contacted through DCOM, set the --
     force option to true.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help , -?
          Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --nodehost
          The name of the host that the node represents. The name
          of  the  host  must  be  specified. Otherwise, an error
          occurs.

     --installdir
          The full path to the parent of  the  base  installation
          directory of the GlassFish Server software on the host,
          for example, C:\glassfish3. The default is  the  parent

          of  the  default  base  installation  directory  of the
          GlassFish Server software for the DAS. This default  is
          useful  only  if  GlassFish  Server is installed in the
          same location on all hosts.

     --nodedir
          The path to the directory that is to contain  GlassFish
          Server  instances  that  are  created  on the node. The
          default is as-install\nodes, where  as-install  is  the
          base  installation  directory  of  the GlassFish Server
          software on the host. If a relative path is  specified,
          the path is relative to the as-install directory.

     --windowsuser , -w
          The user on this node's host that is to run the process
          for connecting to the host through DCOM. The default is
          the user that is running the DAS  process.  If  the  --
          nodehost  option  is  set  to  localhost-domain, the --
          windowsuser option is ignored

     --windowsdomain , -d
          The name of the Windows domain that contains  the  user
          that the --windowsuser option specifies. The default is
          the name of the host on which the subcommand is run.

     --force
          Specifies whether the node is created in the DAS confi-
          guration  even  if  validation of the node's parameters
          fails. To validate a node's parameters, the DAS must be
          able  to contact the node's host through DCOM. Possible
          values are as follows:

          false
               The node is  not  created  if  validation  of  the
               node's parameters fails (default).

          true The node is created  even  if  validation  of  the
               node's parameters fails.

     --install
          Specifies whether  the  GlassFish  Server  software  is
          installed on host that the node represents.

          Possible values are as follows:

          false
               The GlassFish Server software is not installed  on
               the host (default).

          true The GlassFish Server software is installed on  the
               host.

     --archive
          The absolute path to the archive file of the  GlassFish
          Server software that is to be installed. If this option
          is omitted and the --install is  true,  the  subcommand
          creates  a ZIP archive of the GlassFish Server software
          from the installation where this subcommand is run. The
          archive  does  not contain the domains directory or the
          nodes directory.

OPERANDS
     node-name
          The name of the node.

          The name must meet the following requirements:

          o The name may contain only ASCII characters.

          o The name must start with a letter, a  number,  or  an
            underscore.

          o The name may contain only the following characters:

            o Lowercase letters

            o Uppercase letters

            o Numbers

            o Hyphen

            o Period

            o Underscore

          o The name must be unique in the domain and must not be
            the  name  of another node, a cluster, a named confi-
            guration, or a GlassFish Server instance.

          o The name must not be domain,  server,  or  any  other
            keyword that is reserved by GlassFish Server.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Creating a Node

     This  example  creates  the  node  wpmdl1   for   the   host
     wpmdl1.example.com.  By default, the parent of the base ins-
     tallation directory of  the  GlassFish  Server  software  is
     C:\glassfish3.

     Command create-node-dcom executed successfully.

     Example 2 Forcing the Creation of a Node

     This example forces the creation of node xkyd for  the  host
     xkyd.example.com. The node is created despite the failure of
     the DAS to contact the host xkyd.example.com to validate the
     node's parameters.
