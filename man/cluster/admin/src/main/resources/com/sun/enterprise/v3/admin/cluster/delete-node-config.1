asadmin Utility Subcommands                 delete-node-config(1)

NAME
     delete-node-config - deletes a node that is not enabled  for
     remote communication

SYNOPSIS
     delete-node-config [--help] node-name

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-node-config subcommand deletes a node that is not
     enabled  for remote communication from the domain. This sub-
     command does not require secure shell (SSH)  to  be  config-
     ured.

     This subcommand can delete only a node that is  not  enabled
     for remote communication. A node that is enabled for commun-
     ication over SSH must be deleted by using  the  delete-node-
     ssh(1)  subcommand.  To  determine whether a node is enabled
     for communication over SSH, use  the  list-nodes(1)  subcom-
     mand.

     No GlassFish Server instances must reside on the  node  that
     is  being  deleted.  Otherwise, the subcommand fails. Before
     running this subcommand, delete any instances that reside on
     the  node by using, for example, the delete-instance(1) sub-
     command or the delete-local-instance(1) subcommand.

     Note -

       The predefined node localhost-domain cannot be deleted.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

OPERANDS
     node-name
         The name of the node to delete. The  node  must  not  be
         enabled  for communication over SSH. Otherwise, an error
         occurs.
