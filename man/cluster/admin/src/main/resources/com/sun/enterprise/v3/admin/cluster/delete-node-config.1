asadmin Utility Subcommands                 delete-node-config(1)

NAME
     delete-node-config - deletes a node that is not enabled  for
     communication over SSH

SYNOPSIS
     delete-node-config [--help] node-name

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-node-config subcommand deletes a node that is not
     enabled  for  communication over secure shell (SSH) from the
     domain. This subcommand does not require secure shell  (SSH)
     to be configured.

     This subcommand can delete only a node that is  not  enabled
     for  communication over SSH. A node that is enabled for com-
     munication over SSH must be deleted  by  using  the  delete-
     node-ssh(1)  subcommand.  To  determine  whether  a  node is
     enabled for communication over SSH,  use  the  list-nodes(1)
     subcommand.

     No GlassFish Server instances must reside on the  node  that
     is  being  deleted.  Otherwise, the subcommand fails. Before
     running this subcommand, delete any instances that reside on
     the  node by using, for example, the delete-instance(1) sub-
     command or the delete-local-instance(1) subcommand.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

OPERANDS
     node-name
         The name of the node to delete. The  node  must  not  be
         enabled  for communication over SSH. Otherwise, an error
         occurs.
