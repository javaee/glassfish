NAME
     delete-node-ssh - deletes a node that is enabled for commun-
     ication over SSH

SYNOPSIS
     delete-node-ssh [--help]
     [--uninstall={false|true}] [--force={false|true}]
     node-name

DESCRIPTION
     The  delete-node-ssh  subcommand  deletes  a  node  that  is
     enabled  for  communication over secure shell (SSH) from the
     domain. This subcommand does not require SSH to  be  config-
     ured.

     This subcommand can delete only a node that is  enabled  for
     communication  over  SSH.  The subcommand for deleting other
     types of nodes depends on the type of the node:

     o A node that is enabled for communication over the  Distri-
       buted  Component  Object Model (DCOM) remote protocol must
       be deleted by using the delete-node-dcom(1) subcommand.

     o A node that is not enabled for remote  communication  must
       be deleted by using the delete-node-config(1) subcommand.

     To determine whether a node  is  enabled  for  communication
     over SSH, use the list-nodes(1) subcommand.

     No GlassFish Server instances must reside on the  node  that
     is  being  deleted.  Otherwise, the subcommand fails. Before
     running this subcommand, delete any instances that reside on
     the  node by using, for example, the delete-instance(1) sub-
     command or the delete-local-instance(1) subcommand.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help , -?
          Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --uninstall
          Specifies whether  the  GlassFish  Server  software  is
          uninstalled from host that the node represents.

          Possible values are as follows:

          false
               The GlassFish Server software is  not  uninstalled
               from the host (default).

          true The GlassFish Server software is uninstalled  from
               the  host.  By  default,  if  any  node except the
               predefined node localhost-domain  resides  on  any
               host from which GlassFish Server software is being
               uninstalled, the subcommand  fails.  To  uninstall
               the GlassFish Server software from a host on which
               user-defined nodes reside, set the --force  option
               to  true.  If the --force option is true, the sub-
               command removes the entire content of  the  parent
               of the base installation directory.

     --force
          If --uninstall is true, specifies whether  the  subcom-
          mand  uninstalls  the  GlassFish Server software from a
          host even if a user-defined node resides on  the  host.
          Possible values are as follows:

          false
               If a user-defined node  resides  on  a  host,  the
               software  is  not  uninstalled  and the subcommand
               fails (default).

               If the --force option  is  false,  the  subcommand
               removes  only the GlassFish Server software files.
               Other content if the parent of the base  installa-
               tion  directory,  such as configuration files, are
               not removed.

          true The subcommand  uninstalls  the  GlassFish  Server
               software from the host even if a user-defined node
               resides on the host.

               If the --force  option  is  true,  the  subcommand
               removes  the  entire  content of the parent of the
               base installation directory.

OPERANDS
     node-name
          The name of the node to delete. The node  must  enabled
          for communication over SSH. Otherwise, an error occurs.
