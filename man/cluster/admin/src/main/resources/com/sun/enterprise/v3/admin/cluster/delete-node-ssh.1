NAME
     delete-node-ssh - deletes a node that is enabled for commun-
     ication over SSH

SYNOPSIS
     delete-node-ssh [--help] node-name

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-node-ssh   subcommand  deletes  a  node  that  is
     enabled  for  communication over secure shell (SSH) from the
     domain. This subcommand does not require SSH to  be  config-
     ured.

     This subcommand can delete only a node that is  enabled  for
     communication  over SSH. A node that is not enabled for com-
     munication over SSH must be deleted  by  using  the  delete-
     node-config(1)  subcommand.  To  determine whether a node is
     enabled for communication over SSH,  use  the  list-nodes(1)
     subcommand.

     No GlassFish Server instances must reside on the  node  that
     is  being  deleted.  Otherwise, the subcommand fails. Before
     running this subcommand, delete any instances that reside on
     the  node by using, for example, the delete-instance(1) sub-
     command or the delete-local-instance(1) subcommand.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPERANDS
     node-name
