NAME
     stop-instance - stops a running GlassFish Server instance

SYNOPSIS
     stop-instance [--help] [--force={true|false}]
     instance-name

DESCRIPTION
     The  stop-instance  subcommand  stops  a  running  GlassFish
     Server instance.

     The subcommand  can  stop  any  GlassFish  Server  instance,
     regardless  of  how  the  instance was created. For example,
     this subcommand can stop an instance  that  was  created  by
     using the create-local-instance(1) subcommand.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --force
         Specifies whether the instance is stopped immediately.

         Possible values are as follows:

         true

             The instance is stopped immediately (default).

         false
             The subcommand waits  until  all  threads  that  are
             associated with the instance are exited before stop-
             ping the instance.

OPERANDS

                                 ish Server instance to stop.
