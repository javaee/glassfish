NAME
     create-node-config - creates a node that is not enabled  for
     remote communication

SYNOPSIS
     create-node-config [--help]
     [--nodehost node-host]
     [--installdir install-dir] [--nodedir node-dir] node-name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-node-config subcommand creates a node that is not
     enabled for remote communication.

     A node represents a  host  on  which  the  GlassFish  Server
     software  is  installed. A node must exist for every host on
     which GlassFish Server instances reside.

     All operations on a node that is not enabled for remote com-
     munication  must  be  performed  on  the  host that the node
     represents. The domain  administration  server  (DAS)  on  a
     remote  host cannot contact the node. The create-node-config
     subcommand does not require SSH to be configured  to  create
     the node.

     Note -

       To represent the host where the DAS is running,  GlassFish
       Server  provides the predefined node localhost. The prede-
       fined node localhost is not enabled for remote  communica-
       tion.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --nodehost
         The name of the host that the node  represents.  If  the
         name  of  the  host is omitted, no host is specified for
         the node.

     --installdir

         The full path to the parent  of  the  base  installation

         directory  of the GlassFish Server software on the host,
         for example, /export/glassfish3/.  The  default  is  the
         parent of the default base installation directory of the
         GlassFish Server software for the DAS. This  default  is
         useful only if GlassFish Server is installed in the same
         location on all hosts.

     --nodedir

         The path to the directory that is to  contain  GlassFish
         Server  instances  that  are  created  on  the node. The
         default is as-install/nodes,  where  as-install  is  the
         base  installation  directory  of  the  GlassFish Server
         software on the host. If a relative path  is  specified,
         the path is relative to the as-install directory.

OPERANDS
     node-name
         The name of the node.

         The name must meet the following requirements:

             o    The name must start with a letter, a number, or
                  an underscore.

             o    The name may contain only the following charac-

                 o    Numbers

                 o    Hyphen

                 o    Period

                 o    Slash

                 o    Hash

             o    The name must be unique in the domain and  must
                  not  be  the name of another node, a cluster, a
                  named  configuration,  or  a  GlassFish  Server
                  instance.

             o    The name must not be  domain,  server,  or  any
