NAME
     create-node-config - creates a node that is not enabled  for
     remote communication

SYNOPSIS
     create-node-config [--help]
     [--nodehost node-host]
     [--installdir install-dir] [--nodedir node-dir] node-name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-node-config subcommand creates a node that is not
     enabled  for  remote  communication.  The create-node-config
     subcommand does not require SSH to be configured  to  create
     the node.

     A node represents a  host  on  which  the  GlassFish  Server
     software  is  installed. A node must exist for every host on
     which GlassFish Server instances reside.

     Note -

       To represent the host where the DAS is running,  GlassFish
       Server  provides the predefined node localhost-domain. The
       predefined node localhost-domain is not enabled for remote
       communication.

     All administration of  instances  on  a  node  that  is  not
     enabled  for  remote  communication must be performed on the
     host that the node  represents.  The  domain  administration
     server  (DAS)  on  a remote host cannot contact the node. To
     administer instances on a node that represents a  host  that
     is  remote  from the DAS, you must use the following subcom-
     mands:

         o    create-local-instance(1)

         o    delete-local-instance(1)

         o    start-local-instance(1)

     However,  you  may  use  stop-local-instance(1)   or   stop-
     instance(1) to stop the instances.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --nodehost
         The name of the host that the node represents.  If  this
         option is omitted, no host is specified for the node.

     --installdir

         The full path to the parent  of  the  base  installation
         directory  of the GlassFish Server software on the host,
         for example,  /export/glassfish3/.  If  this  option  is
         omitted, no parent of the base installation directory of
         the GlassFish Server software is specified for the node.

     --nodedir
         The path to the directory that is to  contain  GlassFish
         Server  instances  that  are  created  on the node. If a
         relative path is specified, the path is relative to  the
         as-install  directory.   If  this  option is omitted, no
         directory for instances is specified for the node.

OPERANDS
     node-name

         The name of the node.

         The name must meet the following requirements:

             o    The name may contain only ASCII characters.

             o    The name must start with a letter, a number, or
                  an underscore.

             o    The name may contain only the following charac-
                  ters:

             o    The name must be unique in the domain and  must
                  not  be  the name of another node, a cluster, a
                  named  configuration,  or  a  GlassFish  Server
                  instance.

             o    The name must not be  domain,  server,  or  any

                  Server.
