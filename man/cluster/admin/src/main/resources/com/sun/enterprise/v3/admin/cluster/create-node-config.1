asadmin Utility Subcommands                 create-node-config(1)

NAME
     create-node-config - creates a node that is not enabled  for
     communication over SSH

SYNOPSIS
     create-node-config [--help]
     [--nodehost node-host]
     [--installdir install-dir] [--nodedir node-dir] node-name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-node-config subcommand creates a node that is not
     enabled for communication over secure shell (SSH).

     A node represents a  host  on  which  the  GlassFish  Server
     software  is installed. A node must be present on every host
     on which GlassFish Server instances reside.

     All operations on a node that is not enabled for  communica-
     tion  over  SSH  node must be performed on the host that the
     node represents. The domain administration server (DAS) on a
     remote  host cannot contact the node. The create-node-config
     subcommand does not require SSH to be configured  to  create
     the node.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --nodehost
         The name of the host that the node  represents.  If  the
         name  of  the  host is omitted, no host is specified for
         the node.

     --installdir

         The full path to the base installation directory of  the
         GlassFish  Server  software  on  the  host, for example,
         /export/glassfishv3/glassfish.  The   default   is   the
         default  base  installation  directory  of the GlassFish
         Server software. This default is useful only if  GlassF-
         ish  Server  is  installed  in  the same location on all
         hosts.
