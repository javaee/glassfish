NAME
     copy-config - copies  an  existing  named  configuration  to
     create another configuration

SYNOPSIS
     copy-config [--help]
     [--systemproperties (name=value)[:name=value]*]
     source-configuration-name destination-configuration-name

DESCRIPTION
     The copy-config subcommand creates a named configuration  in
     the  configuration of the domain administration server (DAS)
     by copying an existing configuration. The new  configuration
     is  identical  to  the  copied configuration, except for any
     properties  that  you  specify  in  the   --systemproperties
     option.

     The default-config configuration is copied when a standalone
     sever instance or standalone cluster is created.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

     --systemproperties
         Optional attribute name-value pairs for  the  configura-
         tion.  These  properties  override  port settings in the
         configuration.

         The following properties are available:

         HTTP_LISTENER_PORT

             This property specifies the port number of the  port
             that  is  used  to  listen  for HTTP requests. Valid
             values are 1-65535. On UNIX, creating  sockets  that
             listen    on   ports   1-1024   requires   superuser
             privileges.

         HTTP_SSL_LISTENER_PORT
             This property specifies the port number of the  port
             that  is  used  to  listen for HTTPS requests. Valid

             privileges.

         IIOP_LISTENER_PORT

             This property specifies the port number of the  port
             that is used for IIOP connections.

         IIOP_SSL_LISTENER_PORT
             This property specifies the port number of the  port
             that is used for secure IIOP connections.

         IIOP_SSL_MUTUALAUTH_PORT

             This property specifies the port number of the  port
             that is used for secure IIOP connections with client
             authentication.

             This property specifies the port number on which the
             JMX  connector listens. Valid values are 1-65535. On
             UNIX, creating sockets that listen on  ports  1-1024
             requires superuser privileges.
