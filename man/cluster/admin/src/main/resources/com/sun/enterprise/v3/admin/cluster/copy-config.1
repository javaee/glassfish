NAME
     copy-config - copies  an  existing  named  configuration  to
     create another configuration

SYNOPSIS
     copy-config [--help]
     [--systemproperties (name=value)[:name=value]*]
     source-configuration-namedestination-configuration-name

DESCRIPTION
     The copy-config subcommand creates a named configuration  in
     the  configuration of the domain administration server (DAS)
     by copying an existing configuration. The new  configuration
     is  identical  to  the  copied configuration, except for any
     properties  that  you  specify  in  the   --systemproperties
     option.

     The default-config configuration is copied when a standalone
     sever instance or standalone cluster is created.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help , -?
          Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --systemproperties
          Optional attribute name-value pairs for the  configura-
          tion.  These  properties  override port settings in the
          configuration.

          The following properties are available:

          ASADMIN_LISTENER_PORT
               This property specifies the  port  number  of  the
               HTTP port or HTTPS port through which the DAS con-
               nects to the  instance  to  manage  the  instance.
               Valid  values are 1-65535. On UNIX, creating sock-
               ets that listen on ports 1-1024 requires superuser
               privileges.

          HTTP_LISTENER_PORT
               This property specifies the  port  number  of  the
               port  that  is  used  to listen for HTTP requests.
               Valid values are 1-65535. On UNIX, creating  sock-
               ets that listen on ports 1-1024 requires superuser
               privileges.

          HTTP_SSL_LISTENER_PORT
               This property specifies the  port  number  of  the
               port  that  is  used to listen for HTTPS requests.
