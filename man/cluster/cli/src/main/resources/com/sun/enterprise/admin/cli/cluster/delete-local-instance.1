NAME
     delete-local-instance - deletes a GlassFish Server  instance
     on the machine where the subcommand is run

SYNOPSIS
     delete-local-instance [--help]
     [--nodedir node-dir] [--node node-name]
     [instance-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-local-instance  subcommand  deletes  a  GlassFish
     Server  instance on the machine where the subcommand is run.
     This subcommand does not require secure shell  (SSH)  to  be
     configured. You must run this command from the machine where
     the instance resides.

     The subcommand can delete  any  GlassFish  Server  instance,
     regardless  of  how  the  instance was created. For example,
     this subcommand can delete an instance that was  created  by
     using the create-instance(1) subcommand.

     The instance that is being deleted must not be running. Oth-
     erwise, an error occurs.

     The subcommand deletes an instance by performing the follow-
     ing actions:

         o    Removing the instance from the configuration of the
              domain administration server (DAS)

         o    Deleting the instance's files from file system

     If the instance that is being deleted is the  only  instance
     that  is  using  the  node directory, that directory is also
     removed.

     If a standalone instance is deleted,  the  instance's  stan-
     dalone  configuration is also deleted. A standalone instance
     refers to a configuration that is named instance-name-config
     to which no other clusters or unclustered instances refer.

     The delete-local-instance subcommand does  not  contact  the
     DAS  to determine the node on which the instance resides. To
     determine the node on which the instance resides,  the  sub-
     command  searches  the  directory  that  contains  the  node

     directories. If multiple node directories  exist,  the  node
     must be specified as an option of the subcommand.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode and remote mode.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --nodedir
         Specifies the directory  that  contains  the  instance's
         node  directory.  The instance's files are stored in the
         instance's  node   directory.   The   default   is   as-
         install/nodes.

     --node

         Specifies the node on which the instance  resides.  This
         option  may be omitted only if the directory that the --
         nodedir option specifies contains only one  node  direc-
         tory. Otherwise, this option is required.

OPERANDS
     instance-name
         The name of the instance to delete.
