NAME
     import-sync-bundle - imports the  configuration  data  of  a
     clustered instance or standalone instance from a ZIP archive

SYNOPSIS
     import-sync-bundle [--help]
     --instance instance-name
     [--nodedir node-dir] [--node node-name]
     file-name

DESCRIPTION
     The import-sync-bundle subcommand imports the  configuration
     data  of  a clustered instance or standalone instance from a
     ZIP archive that was created  by  the  export-sync-bundle(1)
     subcommand. The subcommand must be run on the host where the
     instance resides.

     Importing an instance's configuration data is  required  for
     the following reasons:

         o    To reestablish the instance after an upgrade

         o    To  synchronize  the  instance  manually  with  the
              domain   administration   server   (DAS)  when  the
              instance cannot contact the DAS

     The subcommand imports an instance's configuration  data  by
     performing the following operations:

         o    Creating  or  updating  the  instance's  files  and
              directories

         o    Attempting to register the instance with the DAS

     If the attempt to register the instance with the DAS  fails,
     the  subcommand  does  not  fail.  Instead,  the  subcommand
     displays a warning that the attempt failed. The warning con-
     tains  the  command to run to register the instance with the
     DAS.

     The import-sync-bundle subcommand does not contact  the  DAS
     to  determine  the  node  on  which the instance resides. To
     determine the node on which the instance resides,  the  sub-
     command searches the directory that contains the node direc-
     tories. If multiple node directories exist, the node must be
     specified as an option of the subcommand.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --instance
         The instance  for  which  configuration  data  is  being
         imported.  The  instance  must  already  exist.  The ZIP
         archive from which the data is being imported must  con-
         tain data for the specified instance.

     --nodedir

         The directory that contains the instance's  node  direc-
         tory.  The instance's files are stored in the instance's
         node directory. The default is as-install/nodes.

     --node
         The node on which the instance resides. This option  may
         be  omitted  only  if  the  directory that the --nodedir
         option specifies contains only one node directory.  Oth-
         erwise, this option is required.

OPERANDS
     file-name

         The name of the file, including the path, that  contains
         the ZIP archive to import. This operand is required.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1  Importing  Configuration  Data  for  a  Clustered
     Instance

     This example imports the  configuration  for  the  clustered
     instance pmd-i-sj01 on the node sj01 from the ZIP archive in
     the                                                     file
     /export/glassfish3/glassfish/domains/domain1/sync/pmdcluster-
     sync-bundle.zip.

       asadmin> import-sync-bundle --instance pmd-i-sj01 --node sj01
       /export/glassfish3/glassfish/domains/domain1/sync/pmdcluster-sync-bundle.zip

       Command import-sync-bundle executed successfully.
