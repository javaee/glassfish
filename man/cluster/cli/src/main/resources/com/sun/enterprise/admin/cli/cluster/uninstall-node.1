NAME
     uninstall-node - uninstalls GlassFish Server  software  from
     specified hosts

SYNOPSIS
     uninstall-node [--help]
     [--installdir install-dir]
     [--sshport ssh-port] [--sshuser ssh-user]
     [--sshkeyfile ssh-keyfile]
     host-list

DESCRIPTION
     The  install-node  subcommand  uninstalls  GlassFish  Server
     software from the hosts that are specified as the operand of
     the subcommand. This subcommand requires secure shell  (SSH)
     to be configured on the machine where the domain administra-
     tion server (DAS) is running and  on  each  host  where  the
     GlassFish Server software is being uninstalled.

     No nodes except the predefined node localhost must reside on
     any host from which GlassFish Server software is being unin-
     stalled. Otherwise, the  subcommand  fails.  Before  running
     this subcommand, delete any nodes that reside on the host by
     using, for example, the appropriate subcommand for  deleting
     the  node,  such  as  delete-node-config(1)  or delete-node-
     ssh(1).

     If multiple hosts are specified, the  configuration  of  the
     following items must be the same on all hosts:

         o    Base installation directory

         o    SSH port

         o    SSH user

         o    SSH key file

     The subcommand does not modify the configuration of the DAS.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --installdir

         The absolute path to the parent of the base installation
         directory   where   the  GlassFish  Server  software  is
         installed     on     each     host,     for     example,
         /export/glassfish3/.

         The user that is running the DAS must have write  access
         to the specified directory. Otherwise, an error occurs.

         The specified directory must contain the installation of
         the GlassFish Server software on the host. Otherwise, an
         error occurs.

         The default is  the  parent  of  the  base  installation
         directory  of  the  GlassFish Server software on the DAS
         host.

     --sshport
         The port to use for SSH connections to  the  host  where
         the  GlassFish Server software is to be uninstalled. The
         default is 22.

     --sshuser

         The SSH user that is to run the process  for  connecting
         to the host where the GlassFish Server software is to be
         uninstalled. The default is the user that is running the
         DAS process. To ensure that the DAS can read this user's
         SSH private key file, specify the user that  is  running
         the DAS process.

     --sshkeyfile
         The absolute path to the SSH private key file  for  user
         that  the  --sshuser option specifies. This file is used
         for authentication to the sshd daemon on the host.

         The path to the key file must be reachable  by  the  DAS
         and  the  key file must be readable by the DAS. The path
         may contain Java properties of the form ${prop.name}.

         The default is the a platform-dependent key file in  the
         user's .ssh directory, for example:

             o    id_rsa

             o    id_dsa

             o    identitylocation

OPERANDS
     host-list
