NAME
     stop-local-instance - stops a GlassFish Server  instance  on
     the machine where the subcommand is run

SYNOPSIS
     stop-local-instance [--help]
     [--nodedir node-dir] [--node node]
     [instance-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The stop-local-instance subcommand stops a GlassFish  Server
     instance  on  the  machine where the subcommand is run. This
     subcommand does not require secure shell (SSH) to be config-
     ured.  You  must run this command from the machine where the
     instance resides.

     The subcommand  can  stop  any  GlassFish  Server  instance,
     regardless  of  how  the  instance was created. For example,
     this subcommand can stop an instance  that  was  created  by
     using the create-instance(1) subcommand.

     The stop-local-instance subcommand does not contact the  DAS
     to  determine  the  node  on  which the instance resides. To
     determine the node on which the instance resides,  the  sub-
     command searches the directory that contains the node direc-
     tories. If multiple node directories exist, the node must be
     specified as an option of the subcommand.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --nodedir
         Specifies the directory  that  contains  the  instance's
         node  directory.  The instance's files are stored in the
         instance's  node   directory.   The   default   is   as-
         install/nodes.

     --node

         Specifies the node on which the instance  resides.  This
         option  may be omitted only if the directory that the --
         nodedir  option  specifies  contains   only   one   node
