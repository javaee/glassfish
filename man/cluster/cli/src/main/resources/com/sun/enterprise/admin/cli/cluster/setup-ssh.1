DESCRIPTION
     The setup-ssh subcommand sets up a secure shell (SSH) key on
     the  hosts  that are specified as the operand of the subcom-
     mand. This key enables GlassFish Server  to  use  public-key
     authentication for authentication of the user's SSH login on
     remote hosts.

     SSH enables GlassFish Server  clusters  that  span  multiple
     hosts  to be administered centrally. When a user runs a sub-
     command for cluster administration  that  acts  on  multiple
     hosts, the subcommand is propagated from the domain adminis-
     tration server (DAS) host to remote hosts.  To  contact  and
     administer remote hosts, GlassFish Server uses SSH. SSH pro-
     vides  confidentiality  and  security  for  data   that   is
     exchanged between the DAS and remote hosts.

     Public-key  authentication  uses  an  SSH  key   pair   that
     comprises the following keys:

         o    A private key, which is stored in a secure location
              on  the  DAS host and which may be protected with a
              passphrase

         o    The public key, which is stored on all  the  remote
              hosts with which the DAS communicates

     The subcommand sets up SSH connectivity between the DAS host
     and remote hosts by automating the following tasks:

         o    Generating an SSH key pair.  If  no  SSH  key  pair
              exits, the default behavior of the subcommand is to
              prompt the user to generate an SSH  key  pair.  The
              SSH  key pair is generated without a passphrase. If
              a passphrase-protected key pair  is  required,  the
              key  pair  must  be generated manually by using the
              ssh-keygen(1) command.

         o    Distributing the public key. The subcommand  copies

              the public key file to the user-home/.ssh directory
              and  installs  the  public   key   in   the   user-
              home/.ssh/authorized_keys file on each remote host.
              user-home is  the  user's  home  directory  on  the
              remote host.

              To distribute the public key, authentication of the
              user's SSH login is required. If the private key is
              protected by a passphrase, the passphrase  is  also
              required.  By  default,  the subcommand prompts the
              user  for  the  password  and,  if  necessary,  the
              passphrase.  To  distribute  the public key without
              being prompted, run the subcommand as follows:

             o    Set the --interactive option of the asadmin(1M)
                  utility to false.

             o    Set the --passwordfile option  of  the  asadmin
                  utility    to    a    file    in    which   the
                  AS_ADMIN_SSHPASSWORD entry  specifies  the  SSH
                  user's password for logging in to the specified
                  hosts.

             o    If a passphrase is required,  ensure  that  the
                  file  that --passwordfile option of the asadmin
                  utility specifies also contains  an  entry  for
                  AS_ADMIN_SSHKEYPASSPHRASE.
         If public key authentication is  already  set  up  on  a
         host,  the  subcommand  informs the user that public key
         authentication is already set up and does not distribute
         the key to the host.

     The subcommand does not require any  configuration  informa-
     tion  from  the DAS and does not modify the configuration of
     the DAS.

     The prerequisites for using this subcommand are as follows:

         o    The ssh(1) client is installed on the DAS host  and
              is accessible through the DAS user's path.

         o    The sshd(1M) daemon is installed and running on all
              hosts where an SSH key is to be set up.

         o    The DAS user has an SSH login on all hosts where an
              SSH key is to be set up.

         o    The ssh-keygen(1) utility is installed on  the  DAS
              host  either  at the default location or in a loca-
              tion that is defined in the DAS user's path.

         o    On Windows systems, the SSH package for  Cygwin  or
              an  MKS  Software  toolkit  that  provides  SSH  is
              installed.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --sshport
         The port to use for SSH connections to  the  host  where
         SSH is being set up. The default is 22.

     --sshuser

         The SSH user that is to run the process  for  connecting
         to  the  host  where  the  SSH  key is to be set up. The
         default is the user that is running this subcommand.  To
         ensure that the DAS can read this user's SSH private key
         file, specify the user that is running the DAS process.

     --sshkeyfile
         The absolute path to the SSH private key file  for  user
         that  the  --sshuser option specifies. This file is used
         for authentication to the sshd daemon on the host.

         The user that is running this subcommand must be able to
         reach  the  path  to the key file and read the key file.
         The  path  may  contain  Java  properties  of  the  form
         ${prop.name}.

         The default is a  platform-dependent  key  file  in  the
         user's  .ssh  directory on the host where the subcommand
         is run. If multiple key files are found, the  subcommand
         uses the following order of preference:

             1.   id_rsa

             2.   id_dsa

             3.   identity

     --sshpublickeyfile

         The absolute path to the SSH public key  file  for  user

         that the --sshuser option specifies. The public key file
         is copied to the user's  .ssh  directory  on  each  host
         where SSH is being set up.

         The user that is running this subcommand must be able to
         reach  the  path  to the key file and read the key file.
         The  path  may  contain  Java  properties  of  the  form
         ${prop.name}.

         The default is a  platform-dependent  key  file  in  the
         user's  .ssh  directory on the host where the subcommand
         is run. If multiple key files are found, the  subcommand
         uses the following order of preference:

             1.   id_rsa.pub

             2.   id_dsa.pub

             3.   identity.pub

     --generatekey

         Specifies whether the subcommand generates the  SSH  key
         files without prompting the user.

         Possible values are as follows:

         true
             The subcommand generates the SSH key  files  without
             prompting the user.

         false

             The behavior of the subcommand  depends  on  whether
             the SSH key files exist:

                 o    If the SSH key files exist, the  subcommand
                      does not generate the files.

                 o    If the SSH key  files  do  not  exist,  the
                      behavior  of  the subcommand depends on the
                      value of the --interactive  option  of  the
                      asadmin utility:

                     o    If the --interactive  option  is  true,
                          the  subcommand  prompts  the  user  to
                          create the files.

                     o    If the --interactive option  is  false,
                          the subcommand fails.
             This value is the default.
