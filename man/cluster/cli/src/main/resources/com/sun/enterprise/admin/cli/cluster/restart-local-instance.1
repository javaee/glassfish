asadmin Utility Subcommands             restart-local-instance(1)

NAME
     restart-local-instance - restarts a running GlassFish Server
     instance on the host where the subcommand is run

SYNOPSIS
     restart-local-instance [--help]
     [--nodedir nodedir] [--node node]
     [--debug={false|true}]
     [--force={true|false}] [--kill={false|true}]
     [instance-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The restart-local-instance subcommand restarts  a  GlassFish
     Server  instance  on  the  host where the subcommand is run.
     This subcommand does not require secure shell  (SSH)  to  be
     configured.  You  must  run this command from the host where
     the instance resides.

     The subcommand can restart any  GlassFish  Server  instance,
     regardless  of  how  the  instance was created. For example,
     this subcommand can restart an instance that was created  by
     using the create-instance(1) subcommand.

     The restart-local-instance subcommand does not  contact  the
     domain  administration server (DAS) to determine the node on
     which the instance resides. To determine the node  on  which
     the  instance resides, the subcommand searches the directory
     that contains the node directories. If multiple node  direc-
     tories exist, the node must be specified as an option of the
     subcommand.

     When this subcommand restarts an instance, the DAS synchron-
     izes  the  instance with changes since the last synchroniza-
     tion as follows:

         o    For the config directory, the DAS synchronizes  the
              instance with all changes.

         o    For the applications directory and  docroot  direc-
              tory,  only  a  change  to a top-level subdirectory
              causes the DAS to synchronize all files under  that
              subdirectory.

              If a file below a top level subdirectory is changed
              without  a  change  to a file in the top level sub-
              directory, full  synchronization  is  required.  In
              normal  operation,  files  below the top level sub-
              directories of these directories are  not  changed.

              If  an application is deployed and undeployed, full
              synchronization is  not  necessary  to  update  the
              instance with the change.

     If  different  synchronization  behavior  is  required,  the
     instance  must  be  stopped and restarted by using following
     sequence of subcommands:

         1.   stop-local-instance(1)

         2.   start-local-instance(1)

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --nodedir
         Specifies the directory  that  contains  the  instance's
         node  directory.  The instance's files are stored in the
         instance's  node   directory.   The   default   is   as-
         install/nodes.

     --node

         Specifies the node on which the instance  resides.  This
         option  may be omitted only if the directory that the --
         nodedir option specifies contains only one  node  direc-
         tory. Otherwise, this option is required.

     --debug
         Specifies whether the instance is  restarted  with  Java
         Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) debugging enabled.

         Possible values are as follows:

         true

             The  instance  is  restarted  with  JPDA   debugging
             enabled  and  the  port number for JPDA debugging is
             displayed.

         false

             The instance is restarted with JPDA  debugging  dis-
             abled (default).

         The default is the current setting of  this  option  for
         the instance that is being restarted.

     --force
         Specifies  whether  the  instance  is  forcibly  stopped
         immediately before it is restarted.

         Possible values are as follows:

         true

             The  instance  is   forcibly   stopped   immediately
             (default).

         false
             The subcommand waits  until  all  threads  that  are
             associated with the instance are exited before stop-
             ping the instance.

     --kill

         Specifies whether the instance is killed  before  it  is
         restarted by using functionality of the operating system
         to terminate the instance process.

         Possible values are as follows:

         false
             The instance is  not  killed.  The  subcommand  uses
             functionality  of  the  JavaTM platform to terminate
             the instance process (default).

         true

             The instance is killed. The  subcommand  uses  func-
             tionality  of  the operating system to terminate the
             instance process.

     instance-name

         The name of the GlassFish Server instance to restart. If
         the  instance  is not running, the subcommand displays a
         warning message and attempts to start the instance.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Restarting an Instance Locally

     This example restarts the  instance  ymlsa1  in  the  domain
     domain1 on the host where the subcommand is run.

       asadmin> restart-local-instance --node localhost-domain1 ymlsa1
       Command restart-local-instance executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
     0                           command executed successfully

     1                           error in executing the command
