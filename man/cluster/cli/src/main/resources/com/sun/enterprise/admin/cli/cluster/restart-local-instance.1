NAME
     restart-local-instance - restarts a running GlassFish Server
     instance on the machine where the subcommand is run

SYNOPSIS
     restart-local-instance [--help]
     [--nodedir nodedir] [--node node]
     [--debug={false|true}]
     [instance-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The restart-local-instance subcommand restarts  a  GlassFish
     Server  instance on the machine where the subcommand is run.
     This subcommand does not require secure shell  (SSH)  to  be
     configured. You must run this command from the machine where
     the instance resides.

     The subcommand can restart any  GlassFish  Server  instance,
     regardless  of  how  the  instance was created. For example,
     this subcommand can restart an instance that was created  by
     using the create-instance(1) subcommand.

     The restart-local-instance subcommand does not  contact  the
     domain  administration server (DAS) to determine the node on
     which the instance resides. To determine the node  on  which
     the  instance resides, the subcommand searches the directory
     that contains the node directories. If multiple node  direc-
     tories exist, the node must be specified as an option of the
     subcommand.

     When this subcommand restarts an instance, the DAS synchron-
     izes the instance only with changes since the last synchron-
     ization to the following files:

         o    All changes in the config directory

         o    Changes to files only  in  the  top  level  of  the
              applications directory and the docroot directory

              If a file below this level is  changed,  full  syn-
              chronization  is  required.  In  normal  operation,
              files below the top level of these directories  are
              not  changed.  If  an  application  is deployed and
              undeployed, full synchronization is  not  necessary
              to update the instance with the change.

     If  different  synchronization  behavior  is  required,  the
     instance  must  be  stopped and restarted by using following
     sequence of subcommands:

         1.   stop-local-instance(1)

         2.   start-local-instance(1)

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --nodedir
         Specifies the directory  that  contains  the  instance's
         node  directory.  The instance's files are stored in the
         instance's  node   directory.   The   default   is   as-
         install/nodes.

     --node

         Specifies the node on which the instance  resides.  This
         option  may be omitted only if the directory that the --
         nodedir option specifies contains only one  node  direc-
         tory. Otherwise, this option is required.

     --debug
         Specifies whether the instance is  restarted  with  Java
         Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) debugging enabled.

         Possible values are as follows:

         true

             The  instance  is  restarted  with  JPDA   debugging
             enabled  and  the  port number for JPDA debugging is
             displayed.

         false
             The instance is restarted with JPDA  debugging  dis-
             abled (default).

         The default is the current setting of  this  option  for
         the instance that is being restarted.

OPERANDS
     instance-name

         The name of the GlassFish Server instance to restart. If
         the  instance  is not running, the subcommand displays a
         warning message and attempts to start the instance.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Restarting an Instance Locally

     This example restarts the instance  ymlsa1  on  the  machine
     where the subcommand is run.

       asadmin> restart-local-instance --node localhost ymlsa1
       Command restart-local-instance executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
     0                           command executed successfully

     1                           error in executing the command
