NAME
     uninstall-node-dcom - uninstalls GlassFish  Server  software
     from specified DCOM-enabled hosts

SYNOPSIS
     uninstall-node-dcom [--help]
     [--installdir as-install-parent]
     [--windowsuser windows-user] [--windowsdomain windows-domain]
     [--force={false|true}]
     host-list

DESCRIPTION
     The  uninstall-node-dcom  subcommand  uninstalls   GlassFish
     Server  software  from  the  hosts that are specified as the
     operand of the subcommand. This subcommand requires the Dis-
     tributed Component Object Model (DCOM) remote protocol to be
     configured on the host where the subcommand is  run  and  on
     each host where the GlassFish Server software is being unin-
     stalled.

     Note

     To uninstall GlassFish Server software  on  hosts  that  use
     secure  shell  (SSH),  use the uninstall-node-ssh(1) subcom-
     mand.

     By  default,  if  any  node  except  the   predefined   node
     localhost-domain  resides  on  any host from which GlassFish
     Server software is being uninstalled, the subcommand  fails.
     To  uninstall  the  GlassFish Server software from a host on
     which user-defined nodes reside, set the --force  option  to
     true.  If the --force option is true, the subcommand removes
     the entire content of the parent of  the  base  installation
     directory.

     If multiple hosts are specified, the  configuration  of  the
     following items must be the same on all hosts:

     o Parent of the base installation directory for the  GlassF-
       ish Server software

     o Windows user

     o Windows domain

     The subcommand does not  modify  the  configuration  of  the
     domain administration server (DAS).

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help , -?
          Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --installdir
          The absolute path to the parent of the  base  installa-
          tion  directory  where the GlassFish Server software is
          installed on each host, for example, C:\glassfish3.

          The user that is  running  this  subcommand  must  have
          write  access to the specified directory. Otherwise, an
          error occurs.

          The specified directory must contain  the  installation
          of  the  GlassFish  Server software on the host. Other-
          wise, an error occurs.

          The default is the  parent  of  the  base  installation
          directory  of the GlassFish Server software on the host
          where this subcommand is run.

     --windowsuser , -w
          The user on this node's host that is to run the process
          for connecting to the host through DCOM. The default is
          the user that is running the DAS process.

     --windowsdomain , -d
          The name of the Windows domain that contains  the  user
          that the --windowsuser option specifies. The default is
          the name of the host on which the subcommand is run.

     --force
          Specifies whether the subcommand uninstalls the GlassF-
          ish  Server software from a host even if a user-defined
          node resides on the host. Possible values are  as  fol-
          lows:

          false
               If a user-defined node  resides  on  a  host,  the
               software  is  not  uninstalled  and the subcommand
               fails (default).

               If the --force option  is  false,  the  subcommand
               removes  only the GlassFish Server software files.
               Other content if the parent of the base  installa-
               tion  directory,  such as configuration files, are
               not removed.

          true The subcommand  uninstalls  the  GlassFish  Server
               software from the host even if a user-defined node
               resides on the host.
