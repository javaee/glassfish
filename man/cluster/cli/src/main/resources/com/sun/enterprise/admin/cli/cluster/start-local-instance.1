NAME
     start-local-instance - starts a GlassFish Server instance on
     the host where the subcommand is run

SYNOPSIS
     start-local-instance [--help]
     [--nodedir node-dir] [--node node]
     [--debug={false|true}] [--sync={normal|full|none}]
     [--upgrade={false|true}] [--verbose={false|true}]
     [instance-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The  start-local-instance  subcommand  starts  a   GlassFish
     Server  instance  on  the  host where the subcommand is run.
     This subcommand does not require secure shell  (SSH)  to  be
     configured.  You  must  run this command from the host where
     the instance resides.

     The subcommand can  start  any  GlassFish  Server  instance,
     regardless  of  how  the  instance was created. For example,
     this subcommand can start an instance that  was  created  by
     using the create-instance(1) subcommand.

     The start-local-instance subcommand  does  not  contact  the
     domain  administration server (DAS) to determine the node on
     which the instance resides. To determine the node  on  which
     the  instance resides, the subcommand searches the directory
     that contains the node directories. If multiple node  direc-
     tories exist, the node must be specified as an option of the
     subcommand.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --nodedir
         Specifies the directory  that  contains  the  instance's
         node  directory.  The instance's files are stored in the
         instance's  node   directory.   The   default   is   as-
         install/nodes.

     --node

         Specifies the node on which the instance  resides.  This
         option  may be omitted only if the directory that the --
         nodedir option specifies contains only one  node  direc-
         tory. Otherwise, this option is required.

     --debug
         Specifies whether the  instance  is  started  with  Java
         Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) debugging enabled.

         Possible values are as follows:

         true

             The instance is started with JPDA debugging  enabled
             and the port number for JPDA debugging is displayed.

         false
             The instance is started with JPDA debugging disabled
             (default).

     --sync

         The type of synchronization  between  the  DAS  and  the
         instance's files when the instance is started.

         Possible values are as follows:

         none
             The DAS does not synchronize  the  instance's  files
             with  any  changes.  This  type  of  synchronization
             minimizes the time that is  required  to  start  the
             instance.

         normal

             The DAS synchronizes the instance with changes since
             the last synchronization as follows:

                 o    For the config directory, the DAS synchron-
                      izes the instance with all changes.

                 o    For the applications directory and  docroot
                      directory,  only  a  change  to a top-level
                      subdirectory causes the DAS to  synchronize
                      all files under that subdirectory.

                      If a file below a top level subdirectory is
                      changed  without  a change to a file in the
                      top level subdirectory,  full  synchroniza-
                      tion  is  required.  In  normal  operation,
                      files below the top level subdirectories of
                      these  directories  are  not changed. If an
                      application  is  deployed  and  undeployed,
                      full  synchronization  is  not necessary to
                      update the instance with the change.
             This value is the default.

         full

             The DAS synchronizes the instance with  all  of  the
             instance's  files,  regardless  of whether the files
             have changed since the  last  synchronization.  This
             type  of  synchronization might delay the startup of
             the instance while the DAS updates all files in  the
             instance's directories.

     --upgrade
         Specifies whether the configuration of the  instance  is
         upgraded  to the current release.  Normally, if the sub-
         command detects that the configuration is from an  older
         release   of  GlassFish  Server,  the  configuration  is
         upgraded automatically before being started. You  should
         not need to use this option explicitly.

         Possible values are as follows:

         true

             When the instance is started, the  configuration  is
             modified  to  be  compatible  with  this  release of
             GlassFish Server, and the GlassFish  Server  process
             stops.

         false
             The configuration of the  instance  is  not  updated
             (default).

      --verbose
     -v

         Specifies  whether  detailed   information   about   the
         instance  is  displayed  in the console window where the
         subcommand is run.

asadmin Utility Subcommands               start-local-instance(1)

         Possible values are as follows:

         true

             Detailed startup messages and log messages about the
             instance  are  displayed in the console window where
             the subcommand is run. If the instance is later res-
             tarted by running the restart-local-instance(1) sub-
             command from a different  console  window,  messages
             continue  to  be  displayed  in the original console
             window.

             You can kill the GlassFish Server process by  typing
             CTRL-C in the console window.

             You can kill the GlassFish Server process and obtain
             a  thread  dump  for the server by typing one of the
             following key combinations in the console window:
                                     TM
                 o    CTRL-\  on UNIX   systems

                 o    CTRL-Break on Windows systems

          false
             Detailed information is not displayed (default).

OPERANDS
     instance-name

         The name of the instance to stop.

     This example starts the  instance  yml-i-sj01  on  the  host
     where the subcommand is run.
