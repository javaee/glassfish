NAME
     install-node - installs GlassFish Server software on  speci-
     fied hosts

SYNOPSIS
     install-node [--help]
     [--archivedir archive-dir]
     [--installdir install-dir]
     [--sshport ssh-port] [--sshuser ssh-user]
     [--sshkeyfile ssh-keyfile]
     host-list

DESCRIPTION
     The  install-node  subcommand  installs   GlassFish   Server
     software  on  the hosts that are specified as the operand of
     the subcommand. This subcommand requires secure shell  (SSH)
     to be configured on the machine where the domain administra-
     tion server (DAS) is running and  on  each  host  where  the
     GlassFish Server software is being installed.

     If necessary, the subcommand creates a ZIP  archive  of  the
     GlassFish  Server  software   from the DAS installation. The
     archive does not contain the domains directory or the  nodes
     directory.  These  directories are synchronized from the DAS
     when instances on nodes that represent the hosts are created
     and  started.  The  subcommand  does  not delete the archive
     after installing the  GlassFish  Server  software  from  the
     archive on the specified hosts.

     If multiple hosts are specified, the  configuration  of  the
     following items is the same on all hosts:

         o    Base installation directory

         o    SSH port

         o    SSH user

         o    SSH key file

     If the SSH key file does not  exist  on  a  host  where  the
     GlassFish Server software is to be installed, the subcommand
     runs interactively and prompts for a password. To enable the
     subcommand to run noninteractively, the following conditions
     must be met:

         o    The --interactive option of the asadmin(1M) utility
              must be false.

         o    The --password option of the asadmin  utility  must
              specify a password file.

         o    The    password    file    must     contain     the
              AS_ADMIN_SSHPASSWORD entry.

     The subcommand does not modify the configuration of the DAS.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --archivedir
         The absolute path to the  directory  that  contains  the
         archive  of  the GlassFish Server software that is to be
         installed. If no archive file that is named glassfsh.zip
         exists  in  the  directory,  the  subcommand  creates an
         archive from the DAS installation.

         The user that is running the DAS must have write  access
         to the specified directory. Otherwise, an error occurs.

         The default depends on whether parent of the  base  ins-
         tallation  directory of the GlassFish Server software on
         the DAS is writable:

             o    If the parent of the base  installation  direc-
                  tory  is writable, the default is the parent of
                  the base installation directory.

             o    If the parent of the base  installation  direc-
                  tory is not writable, the default is the direc-
                  tory that the  java.io.tmpdir  system  property
                  specifies.

     --installdir

         The absolute path to the parent of the base installation
         directory  where  the GlassFish Server software is to be
         installed     on     each     host,     for     example,
         /export/glassfish3/.  If  the  directory does not exist,
         the subcommand creates the directory.

         The user that is running the DAS must have write  access
         to the specified directory. Otherwise, an error occurs.

asadmin Utility Subcommands                       install-node(1)

         The specified directory must not already contain an ins-
         tallation  of  the GlassFish Server software. Otherwise,
         an error occurs.

         The default is  the  parent  of  the  base  installation
         directory  of  the  GlassFish Server software on the DAS
         host.

     --sshport

         The port to use for SSH connections to  the  host  where
         the  GlassFish  Server  software is to be installed. The
         default is 22.

     --sshuser
         The SSH user that is to run the process  for  connecting
         to the host where the GlassFish Server software is to be
         installed. The default is the user that is  running  the
         DAS process. To ensure that the DAS can read this user's
         SSH private key file, specify the user that  is  running
         the DAS process.

     --sshkeyfile

         The absolute path to the SSH private key file  for  user
         that  the  --sshuser option specifies. This file is used
         for authentication to the sshd daemon on the host.

         The path to the key file must be reachable  by  the  DAS
         and  the  key file must be readable by the DAS. The path
         may contain Java properties of the form ${prop.name}.

         The default is the a platform-dependent key file in  the
         user's .ssh directory, for example:

             o    id_rsa

             o    id_dsa

             o    identitylocation

OPERANDS
     host-list
         A space-separated list of the names of the  hosts  where
         the GlassFish Server software is to be installed.
