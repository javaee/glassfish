asadmin Utility Subcommands                create-resource-ref(1)

NAME
     create-resource-ref - creates a reference to a resource

SYNOPSIS
     create-resource-ref [--help] [--target target]
     [--enabled={false|true}] reference_name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-resource-ref subcommand creates a reference  from
     a   server  instance  to  a previously-created resource, for
     example, a JDBC  resource  created  using  the  create-jdbc-
     resource   subcommand.   This  effectively  results  in  the
     resource being made  available  in  the  JNDI  tree  of  the
     instance.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command runs successfully and the option is ignored.

     --enabled

         Indicates whether the resource should be  enabled.  This
         value  will  take effect only if the resource is enabled
         at the global level. The default is true.

OPERANDS
     reference_name
         The name or JNDI name of the resource.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using the create-resource-ref subcommand

     The following subcommand creates a reference to the JMS des-
     tination resource jms/Topic on the cluster Cluster1.
