NAME
     add-resources - creates the resources specified  in  an  XML
     file

SYNOPSIS
     add-resources [--help] [--target target] xml-file-name

DESCRIPTION
     The add-resources subcommand creates the resources named  in
     the  specified  XML  file. The resources that can be created
     with this subcommand are listed in See  Also  in  this  help
     page.

     The --target option specifies the target for which  you  are
     creating the resources. If this option specifies the domain,
     the resources are added only to  the  configuration  of  the
     domain administration server (DAS). If this option specifies
     any other target, the resources are added to the  configura-
     tion  of  the  DAS and references are added to the resources
     from the specified target.

     The xml-file-name operand is the path to the XML  file  that
     contains  the  resources  to be created. The DOCTYPE must be
     specified      as       http://glassfish.org/dtds/glassfish-
     resources_1_5.dtd in the resources.xml file.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Specifies the target for  which  you  are  creating  the
         resources.

         Valid values are as follows:

             instance server and is the default value.

         domain

             Creates the resources for the domain.

         cluster-name
             Creates the resources for every server  instance  in
             the cluster.

         instance-name
                                                               TM
             Creates the resources for a  particular  GlassFish
             Server instance.

OPERANDS
     xml-file-name
         The path to the XML file  that  contains  the  resources
         that  are  to  be  created.  You can specify an absolute
         path, only the file name, or a relative path.

             o    If you specify an absolute path, the  XML  file
                  can be anywhere.

             o    If you specify only the file name, the XML file
                  must        reside       in       the       as-
                  install/domains/domain1/config directory on the
                  DAS  host. This requirement must be met even if
                  you run the subcommand from another host.

             o    If you specify a relative path,  the  XML  file
                  must be in the relative directory.
         An example XML file follows.
