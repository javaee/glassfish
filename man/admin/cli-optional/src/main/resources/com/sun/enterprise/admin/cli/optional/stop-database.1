DESCRIPTION
     The stop-database subcommand stops a process of the Java  DB
     server.  Java DB server is available for use with Enterprise
     Server and is based upon Apache Derby. The database is typi-
     cally  started with the start-database(1) subcommand. A sin-
     gle host can have multiple database server processes running
     on  different  ports. The stop-database subcommand stops the
     database server process for the specified port only.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

         cess.  The  default  is  the  IP  address 0.0.0.0, which
         denotes all network interfaces on the host where you run
         the stop-database subcommand.
