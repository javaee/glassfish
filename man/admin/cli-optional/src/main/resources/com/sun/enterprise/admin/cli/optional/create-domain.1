NAME
     create-domain - creates a domain

SYNOPSIS
     create-domain {--adminport port_number | --portbase portbase}
     [(--profile developer | cluster | enterprise] --template domain_template)]
     [--domaindir domain_directory] [--instanceport port_number]
     [--savemasterpassword={false|true}]
     [--domainproperties (name=value)[:name=value]*]
     [--keytooloptions (name=value)[:name=value]*]
     [--savelogin={false|true}] domain_name
     [--checkports=true] domain_name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-domain subcommand creates the configuration of an
     administrative   domain.   A  domain  is  an  administrative
     namespace. Every domain has a configuration, which is stored
     in  a set of files. Any number of domains, each of which has
     a distinct administrative identity,  can  be  created  in  a
     given  installation of Enterprise Server. A domain can exist
     independent of other domains. Any user who has access to the
     asadmin  utility  on a  given system can create a domain and
     store its configuration in a folder of choice.  By  default,
     the domain configuration is created in the default directory
     for domains. You can override this  location  to  store  the
     configuration elsewhere.

     In addition to being an administrative boundary, a domain is
     also  a  fully compliant Java EE server. This means that you
     can deploy your Java EE applications to the domain  and  run
     them  when  the domain is started. A domain provides all the
     necessary environment and  services  essential  to  run  the
     applications.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --domaindir
         The directory where the domain  is  to  be  created.  If
         specified,  the  path must be accessible in the filesys-
         tem. If not specified, the  domain  is  created  in  the
         default domain directory.

     --profile

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --template
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --adminport

         The HTTP/S port for  administration. This is the port to
         which   you   should   point   your  browser   (example,
         http://localhost:this-port) to manage the domain.

         Either the --adminport option or the  --portbase  option
         must be specified.

     --portbase
         Determines the number with  which  the  port  assignment
         should  start.  A  domain uses a certain number of ports
         that are statically assigned. The portbase value  deter-
         mines  where  the  assignment  should start. Choose this
         value carefully. The values for the ports are calculated
         as  follows:  Admin  port:  portbase + 48, HTTP listener
         port: portbase + 80, IIOP listener port: portbase +  37,
         JMX  port: portbase + 86. See the output of this subcom-
         mand for a complete list  of  occupied  ports,  when  --
         portbase option is specified.

         Note -

           This subcommand uses some ports that are not required.
           This behavior is retained for compatibility with other
           releases.
         Either the --adminport option or the  --portbase  option
         must be specified.

         Note -

           The --portbase option  cannot  be  used  with  the  --
           adminport or the --instanceport option.

     --instanceport

         The  domain provides services so that  applications  can
         run  when deployed. This (HTTP) port specifies where the
         web application context roots are available  for  a  web
         browser  to connect to. This port  is a positive integer
         and must be available at the time of domain creation.

     --savemasterpassword
         Setting this option to true allows the masterpassword to
         be written to the file system. Default is false.

         A master password is really a password  for  the  secure
         key  store. A domain is designed to keep  its own certi-
         ficate (created at the time of  domain  creation)  in  a
         safe place in  the configuration location. This certifi-
         cate is called the domain's SSL server certificate. When
         the   domain is contacted by a web browser over a secure
         channel (HTTPS), this certificate is  presented  by  the
         domain.  The  master password is supposed to protect the
         store (a file) that contains this certificate. This file
         is called keystore.jks and is  created in the configura-
         tion directory of the domain created. If  however,  this
         option  is   chosen, the master password is saved on the
         disk in the domain's configuration location. The  master
         password  is  stored  in  a file called master-password,
         which is a Java JCEKS type   keystore.  The  reason  for
         using  the --savemasterpassword option is for unattended
         system  boots. In this case, the master password is  not
         prompted for when the domain starts because the password
         will be extracted from this file.

         It is best to create a master password when  creating  a
         domain,  because  the  master  password  is  used by the
         start-domain  subcommand.  For  security  purposes,  the
         default setting should be false, because saving the mas-
         ter password on the disk is an insecure practice, unless
         file  system permissions are properly set. If the master
         password is saved, then start-domain does not prompt for
         it. The master password gives an extra level of security
         to the environment.

     --domainproperties

         Setting the  optional  name/value  pairs  overrides  the
         default  values  for  the properties of the domain to be
         created. The list must be separated  by  the  :  (colon)
         character. The following properties are available:

asadmin Utility Subcommands                      create-domain(1)

         jms.port

             Specifies the port number for JMS.  Valid  value  is
             7676.

         domain.jmxPort
             Specifies the port on which  the  JMX  connector  is
             initialized. The valid values are 1-65535.

         orb.listener.port

             Specifies the ORB listener port   for  IIOP  connec-
             tions on which orb-listener-1 listens.

         http.ssl.port
             Specifies the port number for http-listener-2. Valid
             values  are  1  to 65535. On UNIX, to create sockets
             that listen on  ports  1-1024,  you  need  superuser
             privileges.

         orb.ssl.port

             Specifies the ORB listener port for IIOP connections
             on which the IIOP listener called SSL listens.

         orb.mutualauth.port
             Specifies the ORB listener port for IIOP connections
             on  which  the  IIOP  listener called SSL_MUTUALAUTH
             listens.

     --keytooloptions

         Specifies an optional list of name-value pairs  of  key-
         tool  options  for a self-signed server certificate. The
         certificate is generated  during  the  creation  of  the
         domain. Each pair in the list must be separated by the :
         (colon) character.

         Allowed options are as follows:

         CN
             Specifies the common name of the host that is to  be
             used  for  the  self-signed certificate. This option
             name is case insensitive.

asadmin Utility Subcommands                      create-domain(1)

             By default, the name is the fully-qualified name  of
             the  machine  where  the create-domain subcommand is
             run.

      --savelogin

         If set to true, this option saves the  admin  user  name
         and  password.  Default value is false. The username and
         password are stored in the .asadminpass file  in  user's
         home  directory.  A  domain can only be created locally.
         Therefore, when using the --savelogin option,  the  host
         name  saved  in .asadminpass is always localhost. If the
         user has specified default admin port while creating the
         domain,   there   is  no  need  to  specify  --user,  --
         passwordfile, --host, or --port on any of the subsequent
         asadmin  remote  commands. These values will be obtained
         automatically.

         Note -

           When the same user creates multiple domains having the
           same  admin  port  number  on  the  same  or different
           machines (where the home directory  is  NFS  mounted),
           the  subcommand does not ask if the password should be
           overwritten. The password will always be overwritten.

     --checkports
         Specifies whether to check for the availability  of  the
         Admin,  HTTP, JMS, JMX, and IIOP ports. Default value is
         true.

OPERANDS
     domain_name                 The name of  the  domain  to  be
                                 created.
