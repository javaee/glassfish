asadmin Utility Subcommands                     start-database(1)

NAME
     start-database - starts the Java DB

SYNOPSIS
     start-database [--help] [--jvmoptions jvm-options]
     [--dbhost host] [--dbport port-no]
     [--dbhome db-file-path]

DESCRIPTION
     The start-database subcommand starts the Java DB server that
     is available for use with GlassFish Server. Java DB is based
     upon Apache Derby. Use this subcommand only for working with
     applications deployed to the server.

     When you start Java DB server by  using  the  start-database
     subcommand, the database server is started in Network Server
     mode.  Clients  connecting  to  it  must  use  the  Java  DB
     ClientDriver.  For  details  on  connecting to the database,
     refer to the Apache Derby documentation.

     When the database server starts, or a client connects to  it
     successfully, the following files are created:

     o The derby.log file that contains the database server  pro-
       cess log along with its standard output and standard error
       information

     o The database files that contain your schema (for  example,
       database tables)

     These files are created at the location that is specified by
     the  --dbhome option. To create the database files at a par-
     ticular location, you must set the --dbhome option.  If  the
     --dbhome option is not specified, the start-database subcom-
     mand determines where to create these files as follows:

     o If the current working directory contains a file  that  is
       named derby.log, the start-database subcommand creates the
       files in the current working directory.

     o Otherwise, the start-database subcommand creates the files
       in the as-install/databases directory.

     The start-database subcommand starts the  database  process,
     even if it cannot write to the log file.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help , -?

     --jvmoptions
          A space-separated list of command-line options that are
          passed  to the Java application launcher when the data-
          base is started. By default, no options are passed.

          The format of an option depends on whether  the  option
          has a name and a value or only a name:

          o If the option has a name and a value, the  format  is
            option-name=value.

          o If the option has only a name, the format is  option-
            name. For example, -Xmx512m.

     --dbhost
          The host name or IP address of the Java DB server  pro-
          cess.  The  default  is  the  IP address 0.0.0.0, which
          denotes all network interfaces on the  host  where  you
          run the start-database subcommand.

     --dbport
          The port number where the Java DB  server  listens  for
          client connections. This port must be available for the
          listen socket, otherwise the database server  will  not
          start. The default is 1527.

     --dbhome
          The absolute path to the directory where  the  database
          files  and  the  derby.log  file are created. If the --
          dbhome option is not specified, the start-database sub-
          command  determines where to create these files as fol-
          lows:

          o If the current working directory contains a file that
            is  named  derby.log,  the  start-database subcommand
            creates the files in the current working directory.

          o Otherwise, the start-database subcommand creates  the
            files in the as-install/databases directory.

     To create the database files at a particular  location,  you
     must set the --dbhome option.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Starting Java DB

     This example starts Java DB on the host host1 and port 5001.
     asadmin> start-database --dbhost host1 --dbport 5001 --terse=true
     Starting database in the background.  Log redirected to
     /opt/SUNWappserver/databases/derby.log.

     Example 2 Starting Java DB With Options for the Java  Appli-
     cation Launcher

     This example starts Java DB with the options for setting the
     minimum  heap  memory  size to 128 megabytes and the maximum
     heap memory size to 512 megabytes.
     asadmin> start-database --jvmoptions="-Xms128m -Xmx512m" --terse=true
     Starting database in the background.
     Log redirected to /export/glassfish3/glassfish/databases/derby.log.

EXIT STATUS
     The exit status applies to errors in executing  the  asadmin
     utility.   For  information  on  database  errors,  see  the
     derby.log file. This file is located in  the  directory  you
     specify  by  using  the  --dbhome  option  when  you run the
     start-database subcommand. If you did not specify  --dbhome,
     the value of DERBY_INSTALL defaults to as-install/javadb.

     0    subcommand executed successfully

     1    error in executing the subcommand
