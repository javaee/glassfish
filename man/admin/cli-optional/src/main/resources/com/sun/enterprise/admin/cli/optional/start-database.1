asadmin Utility Subcommands                     start-database(1)

NAME
     start-database - starts the Java DB

SYNOPSIS
     start-database [--help] [--dbhost host] [--dbport port-no]
     [--dbhome db-file-path]

DESCRIPTION
     The start-database subcommand starts the Java DB server that
     is  available  for  use  with  Enterprise Server. Java DB is
     based upon Apache Derby. Use this subcommand only for  work-
     ing with applications deployed to the server.

     When you start Java DB server by  using  the  start-database
     subcommand, the database server is started in Network Server
     mode.  Clients  connecting  to  it  must  use  the  Java  DB
     ClientDriver.  For  details  on  connecting to the database,
     refer to the Apache Derby documentation.

     When the database server starts, or a client connects to  it
     successfully, the following files are created:

         o    The  derby.log  file  that  contains  the  database
              server  process  log along with its standard output
              and standard error information

         o    The database files that contain  your  schema  (for
              example, database tables)

     These files are created at the location that is specified by
     the  --dbhome option. To create the database files at a par-
     ticular location, you must set the --dbhome option.  If  the
     --dbhome option is not specified, the start-database subcom-
     mand determines where to create these files as follows:

         o    If the current working directory  contains  a  file
              that is named derby.log, the start-database subcom-
              mand creates  the  files  in  the  current  working
              directory.

         o    Otherwise, the  start-database  subcommand  creates
              the files in the as-install/databases directory.

     The start-database subcommand starts the  database  process,
     even if it cannot write to the log file.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --dbhost
         The host name or IP address of the Java DB  server  pro-
         cess.  The  default  is  the  IP  address 0.0.0.0, which
         denotes all network interfaces on the host where you run
         the start-database subcommand.

     --dbport

         The port number where the Java  DB  server  listens  for
         client  connections. This port must be available for the
         listen socket, otherwise the database  server  will  not
         start. The default is 1527.

     --dbhome
         The absolute path to the directory  where  the  database
         files  and  the  derby.log  file  are created. If the --
         dbhome option is not specified, the start-database  sub-
         command  determines  where to create these files as fol-
         lows:

             o    If the current  working  directory  contains  a
                  file   that  is  named  derby.log,  the  start-
                  database subcommand creates the  files  in  the
                  current working directory.

             o    Otherwise,   the   start-database    subcommand
                  creates  the  files in the as-install/databases
                  directory.
         To create the database files at a  particular  location,
         you must set the --dbhome option.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Starting Java DB

     This example starts Java DB on the host host1 and port 5001:

       asadmin> start-database --dbhost host1 --dbport 5001 --terse=true
       Starting database in the background.  Log redirected to /opt/SUNWappserver/databases/derby.log.

EXIT STATUS
     The exit status applies to errors in executing  the  asadmin
     utility.   For  information  on  database  errors,  see  the
     derby.log file. This file is located in  the  directory  you
     specify  by  using  the  --dbhome  option  when  you run the
     start-database subcommand. If you did not specify  --dbhome,
     the value of DERBY_INSTALL defaults to as-install/javadb.

     0                           subcommand executed successfully
