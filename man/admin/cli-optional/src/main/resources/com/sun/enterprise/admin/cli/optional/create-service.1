NAME
     create-service - configures the starting of a  DAS  or  node
     agent on an unattended boot

SYNOPSIS
     create-service [--name servicename] [--serviceproperties serviceproperties]
     [--dry-run={false|true}] [--domaindir domain-dir] [domain-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The create-service subcommand configures the starting  of  a
     DAS or node agent on an unattended boot by using the Solaris
     10 Service Management Facility (SMF). This  subcommand  must
     be run as the OS-level user with superuser privileges. After
     this subcommand creates the service, you must start, enable,
     disable,  delete,  or  stop  the service. The DAS/node-agent
     configuration must be  stored  on  a  folder  to  which  the
     superuser  has access and cannot be stored on a network file
     system. The service is created such that it is controlled by
     the  OS-level user, who owns the folder where the configura-
     tion of the DAS or node agent resides.

     To run this subcommand, you must have solaris.smf.* authori-
     zation.  (Refer  to  the useradd and usermod man pages.) You
     must also have  write  permission  in  the  directory  tree:
     /var/svc/manifest/application/SUNWappserver.   Usually,  the
     superuser has both these permissions. To run these  commands
     as non-root user, the system administrator must be contacted
     so that the relevant authorizations are granted.   You  need
     to also ensure that:

         o    Solaris 10 administration commands such as  svccfg,
              svcs,  and auths are available in the PATH, so that
              these commands can be executed. A simple test to do
              so  is  to  issue the subcommand, which svccfg on a
              bash shell.

         o    You should have  write  permission  for  the  path,
              /var/svc/manifest/application.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS

     --name

          Indicates the name of the  service  and  overrides  the
         default, if present.

     --serviceproperties
          Specifies a : (colon)-separated list of various proper-
         ties  that  are specific to the service. For Solaris 10,
         if you specify  net_privaddr,  the  service's  processes
         will  be able to bind to the privileged ports (<1024) on
         the platform. You can bind to ports< 1024  only  if  the
         owner  of  the  service is superuser, otherwise, this is
         not allowed. If  you  specify  startinstances=true/false
         for a node agent, all the instances are started when the
         node agent starts.

     --dry-run

         Default is false.

     --domaindir

OPERANDS
     domain-name

          The absolute path of directory on  disk  that  contains
         the configuration of the domain or node agent.
