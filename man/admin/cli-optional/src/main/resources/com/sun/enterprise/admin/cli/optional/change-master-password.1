asadmin Utility Subcommands             change-master-password(1)

NAME
     change-master-password - changes the master password

SYNOPSIS
     change-master-password [--help] [--domaindir domain_path | --agentdir node-agent_path]
     [--nodedir node_name]
      [--savemasterpassword={false|true}] [domain_name | node_agent_name]

DESCRIPTION
     The change-master-password subcommand is used to modify  the
     master  password.  The  change-master-password subcommand is
     interactive in that the user is prompted for the old  master
     password,  as  well as the new master password. This subcom-
     mand will not work unless the server is stopped. In  a  dis-
     tributed  environment, this command must run on each machine
     in the domain, with the node agent stopped.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --domaindir
         This option specifies the directory used for this opera-
         tion.    By   default,   the   --domaindir   option   is
         $AS_DEF_DOMAINS_PATH, which is an  environment  variable
         defined in the file asenv.bat or asenv.conf.

         Do not specify the --domaindir option and the --agentdir
         option in the same command. Use one option or the other.

     --agentdir

         Like a domain administration  server  (DAS),  each  node
         agent   resides   in   a   top   level  directory  named
         agentdir/nodeagent-name. If the --agentdir option is not
         specified,                 the                 directory
         $AS_DEF_DOMAINS_PATH/../nodeagents is used.

         Do not specify the --domaindir option and the --agentdir
         option in the same command. Use one option or the other.

     --nodedir
         The name of specific node instance to which the  subcom-
         mand should apply. If this option is omitted, the change
         is applied to the entire domain.

     --savemasterpassword

         This option indicates whether the master password should
         be written to the file system. This is necessary so that
         the start-domain(1) command can start the server without
         having to prompt the user.

         The default is false.

         Caution -

           Saving  the  master  password  on  disk  is  extremely
           insecure and should be avoided.

         Note -

           If the --savemasterpassword option  is  not  set,  the
           master password file, if it exists, will be deleted.

OPERANDS
     domain_name
         This is the domain name whose password is to be changed.
         If there is only a single domain, this is optional.

     node_agent_name

         This is the name of the node agent whose password is  to
         be changed.

     node_dir
         The directory containing the node instance for which the
         password will be changed.
