NAME
     change-master-password - changes the master password

SYNOPSIS
     change-master-password
     [--help]
      [ --domaindir  domain_path | --agentdir node-agent_path]
      [--savemasterpassword={false|true}] [domain_name | node_agent_name]

DESCRIPTION
     This local subcommand is used to modify the master password.
     The change-master-password subcommand is interactive in that
     the user is prompted for the old master password, as well as
     the  new  master  password.  This  subcommand  will not work
     unless the server is stopped. In a distributed  environment,
     this  command  must  run on each machine in the domain, with
     the node agent stopped.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --domaindir
         This option specifies the directory used for this opera-
         tion.    By   default,   the   --domaindir   option   is
         $AS_DEF_DOMAINS_PATH, which is an  environment  variable
         defined in the file asenv.bat or asenv.conf.

         Do not specify the --domaindir option and the --agentdir
         option in the same command. Use one option or the other.

     --agentdir

         Like a domain administration  server  (DAS),  each  node
         agent   resides   in   a   top   level  directory  named
         agentdir/nodeagent-name. If the --agentdir option is not
         specified,                 the                 directory
         $AS_DEF_DOMAINS_PATH/../nodeagents is used.

         Do not specify the --domaindir option and the --agentdir
         option in the same command. Use one option or the other.

     --savemasterpassword
         This option indicates whether the master password should
         be written to the file system. This is necessary so that
         the start-domain(1) command can start the server without

         having to prompt the user.

         The default is false.

         Caution -

           Saving  the  master  password  on  disk  is  extremely
           insecure and should be avoided.

         Note -

           If the --savemasterpassword option  is  not  set,  the
           master password file, if it exists, will be deleted.

OPERANDS
     domain_name

         This is the domain name whose password is to be changed.
         If there is only a single domain, this is optional.

     node_agent_name
         This is the name of the node agent whose password is  to
         be changed.
