NAME
     backup-domain - performs a backup on the domain

SYNOPSIS
     backup-domain  [--domaindir domain_directory]
      [--description description] [--echo={true | false}][--terse={true | false}]
      [--verbose=false] [domain_name]

DESCRIPTION
     The backup-domain command backs up  files  under  the  named
     domain. This command is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --domaindir

         This option specifies the parent directory of the domain
         upon  which  the  command  will  operate. The default is
         install-dir/domains.

     --description
         A description can contain any string  to  help  identify
         the  particular  backup. The description is displayed as
         part of the information for any backup.

     -e --echo

         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -t --terse
         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -v --verbose

         Indicates that output data is  displayed  with  detailed
         information. Default is false.

OPERANDS
     domain_name
         This is the name of the domain to be backed up.  If  the
         domain  is  not specified and only one domain exists, it
         will be used automatically. If you have  more  than  one
         domain, it is mandatory to specify a domain name.
