NAME
     unset - removes one or more  variables  from  the  multimode
     environment

SYNOPSIS
     unset [--help] [[variable-name]*]

DESCRIPTION
     The unset subcommand removes one or more  environment  vari-
     ables  that  you  set  for  the multimode environment. After
     removal, the variables and their associated values  will  no
     longer apply to the multimode environment.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

OPERANDS
     variable-name       Environment variable to be  removed.  To
                         list  the environment variables that are
                         set, use the export  subcommand  without
                         options. If no environment variables are
                         listed, then you have not set any.

EXAMPLES
