asadmin Utility Subcommands                        stop-domain(1)

NAME
     stop-domain - stops the Domain Administration Server of  the
     specified domain

SYNOPSIS
     stop-domain [--help] [--domaindir domaindir]
     [--force={true|false}] [--kill={false|true}]
     [domain-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The stop-domain subcommand stops the  Domain  Administration
     Server  (DAS) of the specified domain.  If the domain direc-
     tory is not specified, the domain  in  the  default  domains
     directory  is  stopped.  If there are two or more domains in
     the domains  directory,  the  domain-name  operand  must  be
     specified.

     This subcommand is supported in local or remote mode. If you
     specify  a host name, the subcommand assumes you are operat-
     ing in remote mode, which means you must correctly authenti-
     cate  to  the  remote server. In local mode, you normally do
     not need to authenticate to the server as long  as  you  are
     running  the  subcommand  as  the  same user who started the
     server.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --domaindir
         Specifies the directory of the  domain  that  is  to  be
         stopped.  If  specified,  the path must be accessible in
         the file system. If not specified,  the  domain  in  the
         default    as-install/glassfish/domains   directory   is
         stopped.

     --force

         Specifies whether the domain is forcibly stopped immedi-
         ately.

         Possible values are as follows:

         true
             The   domain   is   forcibly   stopped   immediately
             (default).

         false

             The subcommand waits  until  all  threads  that  are
             associated  with  the domain are exited before stop-
             ping the domain.

     --kill
         Specifies whether the domain is killed  by  using  func-
         tionality  of  the  operating  system  to  terminate the
         domain process.

         Possible values are as follows:

         false

             The domain is not killed. The subcommand uses  func-
             tionality  of  the  Java  platform  to terminate the
             domain process (default).

         true
             The domain is  killed.  The  subcommand  uses  func-
             tionality  of  the operating system to terminate the
             domain process.
