asadmin Utility Subcommands                        stop-domain(1)

NAME
     stop-domain -  stops the Domain Administration Server of the
     specified domain

SYNOPSIS
     stop-domain [--help] [--domaindir domaindir] [domain_name]

DESCRIPTION
     The stop-domain subcommand stops the  Domain  Administration
     Server  (DAS) of the specified domain.  If the domain direc-
     tory is not specified, the domain  in  the  default  domains
     directory  is  stopped.  If there are two or more domains in
     the domains  directory,  the  domain_name  operand  must  be
     specified.

     This subcommand is supported in local or remote mode. If you
     specify  a host name, the subcommand assumes you are operat-
     ing in remote mode, which means you must correctly authenti-
     cate  to  the  remote server. In local mode, you normally do
     not need to authenticate to the server as long  as  you  are
     running  the  subcommand  as  the  same user who started the
     server.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --domaindir
         Specifies the directory of the  domain  that  is  to  be
         stopped.  If  specified,  the path must be accessible in
         the file system. If not specified,  the  domain  in  the
         default    as-install/glassfish/domains   directory   is
         stopped.

OPERANDS
     domain_name         The name of the domain you want to stop.
                         Default  is  the  name  specified during
                         installation, usually domain1.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Stopping a Domain
