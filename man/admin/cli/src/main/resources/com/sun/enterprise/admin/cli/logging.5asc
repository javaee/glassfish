NAME
     logging - capturing information on GlassFish Server  runtime
     events

DESCRIPTION
     Logging is the process by which  GlassFish  Server  captures
     data  about events that occur during GlassFish Server opera-
     tion. GlassFish Server components and application components
     generate  logging  data,  which  is saved in the server log,
     typically domain-dir/logs/server.log. The server log is  the
     first  source  of  information  if GlassFish Server problems
     occur.

     The server log is rotated when the file reaches  the  speci-
     fied  size  in bytes, or the specified time has elapsed. The
     file can also be rotated manually by  using  the  rotate-log
     subcommand.

     In addition to the server log, the domain-dir/logs directory
     contains two other kinds of logs:

         o    HTTP service access logs, located  in  the  /access
              subdirectory

         o    Transaction service logs, located in the  /tx  sub-
              directory

     Logging levels can be configured by using the Administration
     Console or the set-log-level subcommand.  Additional proper-
     ties can be set by using the Administration  Console  or  by
     editing    the    logging.properties   file.   The   default
     logging.properties file  is  typically  located  in  domain-
     dir/config.

     Although application components can use the  Apache  Commons
     Logging  Library  to  record messages, the platform standard
     JSR 047 API is recommended for better log configuration.
