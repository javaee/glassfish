DESCRIPTION
     Use the asadmin utility to perform administrative tasks  for
     Oracle GlassFish Server. You can use this utility instead of
     the Administration Console interface.

  SUBCOMMANDS OF THE asadmin UTILITY
     The subcommand identifies the operation or task that you are
     performing.  Subcommands are case-sensitive. Each subcommand
     is either a local subcommand or a remote subcommand.

     o A local subcommand can be run  without  a  running  domain
       administration  server  (DAS). However, to run the subcom-
       mand and have access to the installation directory and the
       domain  directory,  the  user  must  be  logged  in to the
       machine that hosts the domain.

     o A remote subcommand is always run by connecting to  a  DAS
       and  running  the  subcommand  there.  A  running  DAS  is
       required.

  asadmin UTILITY OPTIONS AND SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS
     Options control the behavior of the asadmin utility and  its
     subcommands. Options are also case-sensitive.

     The asadmin utility has the following types of options:

     o asadminutility options. These options control the behavior
       of  the  asadmin  utility, not the subcommand. The asadmin
       utility options may precede or follow the subcommand,  but
       asadmin  utility  options  after the subcommand are depre-
       cated. All asadmin utility options must either precede  or
       follow  the  subcommand.  If  asadmin  utility options are
       specified both before and after the subcommand,  an  error
       occurs.  For a description of the asadmin utility options,
       see the "Options" section of this help information.

Utility Commands                                      asadmin(1m)

     o Subcommand options. These options control the behavior  of
       the   subcommand,  not  the  asadmin  utility.  Subcommand
       options must follow the subcommand. For a description of a
       subcommand's  options,  see  the  help information for the
       subcommand.

     A subcommand option may have the same  name  as  an  asadmin
     utility  option, but the effects of the two options are dif-
     ferent.

     The asadmin utility options and some subcommand options have
     a long form and a short form.

     o The long form of an option has two dashes (--) followed by
       an option word.

     o The short form of an option has a single dash (-) followed
       by a single character.

     For example, the long form and the short form of the  option
     for specifying terse output are as follows:

     o Long form: --terse

     o Short form: -t

     Most  options  require  argument  values,   except   Boolean
     options, which toggle to enable or disable a feature.

  OPERANDS OF asadmin SUBCOMMANDS
     Operands specify the items on which  the  subcommand  is  to
     act.  Operands must follow the argument values of subcommand
     options, and are set off by a space, a tab, or double dashes
     (--).  The  asadmin utility treats anything that follows the
     subcommand options and their values as an operand.

  ESCAPE CHARACTERS IN OPTIONS FOR THE asadmin UTILITY
     Escape characters are required in  options  of  the  asadmin
     utility for the following types of characters:

     o Meta characters in the UNIX operating system. These  char-
       acters have special meaning in a shell. Meta characters in
       the UNIX operating system include: \/,.!$%^&*|{}[]"'`~;.

       To disable these characters, use the backslash (\)  escape
       character  or  enclose the entire command-line argument in
       single quote (') characters.

       The following examples illustrate  the  effect  of  escape
       characters  on  the  *  character.  In these examples, the
       current working directory is the domains directory.

Utility Commands                                      asadmin(1m)

       o The following command,  without  the  escape  character,
         echoes all files in the current directory:
         prompt% echo *
         domain1 domain2

       o The following command, in which the backslash (\) escape
         character precedes the * character, echoes the * charac-
         ter:
         prompt% echo \*
         *

       o The following command,  in  which  the  *  character  is
         enclosed  in  single  quote (') characters, echoes the *
         character:
         prompt% echo '*'
         *

     The escape character is also a special character in the UNIX
     operating system and in the Java language. Therefore, in the
     UNIX operating system and in multimode, you  must  apply  an
     additional escape character to every escape character in the
     command line. This requirement does not apply to the Windows
     operating system.

     For example, the backslash (\) UNIX  operating  system  meta
     character  in  the  option argument Test\Escape\Character is
     specified on UNIX and Windows systems as follows:

       o On UNIX systems, each backslash must be escaped  with  a
         second backslash:
         Test\\Escape\\Character

       o On Windows systems, no escape character is required:
         Test\Escape\Character

     Note

     In contexts where meta characters in the UNIX operating sys-
     tem  are unambiguous, these characters do not require escape
     characters. For example, in the set(1) subcommand, the value
     that  is  to be set is specified as name=value. Because name
     can never include an equals sign,  no  escape  character  is
     required  to  disable the equals sign. Therefore, everything
     after the equals sign is an uninterpreted  string  that  the
     set subcommand uses unchanged.

Utility Commands                                      asadmin(1m)

     o Spaces. The space is the  separator  in  the  command-line
       interface.  To distinguish a space in a command-line argu-
       ment from the separator in the command-line interface, the
       space must be escaped as follows:

       o For the UNIX operating system in single  mode  and  mul-
         timode,  and for all operating systems in multimode, use
         the backslash (\) escape character or enclose the entire
         command-line  argument in single quote (') characters or
         double quote (") characters.

       o For the Windows operating system in single mode, enclose
         the  entire  command-line  argument  in double quote (")
         characters.

     o Option delimiters. The  asadmin  utility  uses  the  colon
       character  (:)  as  a  delimiter  for  some  options.  The
       backslash (\) escape character is required if the colon is
       part of any of the following items:

       o A property

       o An option of the Virtual Machine for the  Java  platform
         (Java  Virtual  Machine  or  JVM machine)The terms "Java
         Virtual Machine" and "JVM" mean a  Virtual  Machine  for
         the Java platform.

     For example,  the  operand  of  the  subcommand  create-jvm-
     options(1)  specifies  JVM  machine options in the following
     format:
     (jvm-option-name[=jvm-option-value])
     [:jvm-option-name[=jvm-option-value]]*

     Multiple JVM machine options in the operand of  the  create-
     jvm-options subcommand are separated by the colon (:) delim-
     iter. If  jvm-option-name  or  jvm-option-value  contains  a
     colon, the backslash (\) escape character is required before
     the colon.

     The backslash (\) escape character is also required before a
     single  quote  (') character or a double quote (") character
     in an option that uses the colon as a delimiter.

     When used without single quote (')  characters,  the  escape
     character  disables the option delimiter in the command-line
     interface.

     For the UNIX operating system in single mode and  multimode,
     and  for  all  operating  systems  in  multimode,  the colon

Utility Commands                                      asadmin(1m)

     character and the backslash character in an option that uses
     the colon as a delimiter must be specified as follows:

       o To  pass  a  literal  backslash  to  a  subcommand,  two
         backslashes  are required. Therefore, the colon (:) must
         be escaped by two backslashes (\\).

       o To prevent a subcommand from treating the backslash as a
         special  character,  the backslash must be escaped. As a
         result, two literal backslashes (\\) must be  passed  to
         the  subcommand.  To prevent the shell from interpreting
         these backslashes as special characters, each  backslash
         must be escaped. Therefore, the backslash must be speci-
         fied by a total of four backslashes (\\\\).

     For the Windows operating system in single mode, a backslash
     (\)  is  required  to escape the colon (:) and the backslash
     (\) in an option that uses the colon as a delimiter.

     Instead of using the backslash (\) escape character, you can
     use the double quote (") character or single quote (') char-
     acter. The effects of the different types of  quote  charac-
     ters on the backslash (\) character are as follows:

     o Between double quote (")  characters,  the  backslash  (\)
       character is a special character.

     o Between single quote (')  characters,  the  backslash  (\)
       character is not a special character.

  REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THE --secure OPTION
     The requirements for using the --secure option are  as  fol-
     lows:

     o The domain that you are administering must  be  configured
       for security.

     o The security-enabled attribute of the  http-listener  ele-
       ment in the DAS configuration must be set to true.

       To set this attribute, use the set subcommand.

  SERVER RESTART AFTER CREATION OR DELETION
     When you use the asadmin subcommands to create or  delete  a
     configuration  item, you must restart the DAS for the change
     to take  effect.  To  restart  the  DAS,  use  the  restart-
     domain(1) subcommand.

  HELP INFORMATION FOR SUBCOMMANDS AND THE asadmin UTILITY
     To obtain help information for an  asadmin  utility  subcom-
     mand,  specify  the subcommand of interest as the operand of

     the help subcommand. For example, to obtain help information
     for the start-domain(1) subcommand, type:
     asadmin help start-domain
     If you run the help subcommand without an operand, this help
     information for the asadmin utility is displayed.

     To obtain a listing of available  asadmin  subcommands,  use
     the list-commands(1) subcommand.

OPTIONS
     --host , -H
          The machine name where the DAS is running. The  default
          value is localhost.

     --port , -p
          The HTTP port or HTTPS port  for  administration.  This
          port  is  the  port in the URL that you specify in your
          web browser to manage the domain. For example,  in  the
          URL http://localhost:4949, the port is 4949.

          The default port number for administration is 4848.

     --user , -u
          The user name of the authorized administrative user  of
          the DAS.

          If you have authenticated to  a  domain  by  using  the
          asadmin  login command, you need not specify the --user
          option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile , -W
          Specifies the name, including the full path, of a  file
          that contains password entries in a specific format.

          The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_ prefix
          followed  by the password name in uppercase letters, an
          equals sign, and the password.

          The entries in the file that are read  by  the  asadmin
          utility are as follows:

          o AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=administration-password

          o AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD=master-password

     The entries in this file that are read by subcommands are as
     follows:

          o AS_ADMIN_NEWPASSWORD=new-administration-password
            (read by the start-domain(1) subcommand)

Utility Commands                                      asadmin(1m)

          o AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD=user-password  (read   by   the
            create-file-user(1) subcommand)

          o AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD=alias-password  (read  by  the
            create-password-alias(1) subcommand)

          o AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD=mapped-password (read by  the
            create-connector-security-map(1) subcommand)

          o AS_ADMIN_WINDOWSPASSWORD=windows-password  (read   by
            the  create-node-dcom(1),  install-node-dcom(1),  and
            update-node-dcom(1) subcommands)

          o AS_ADMIN_SSHPASSWORD=sshd-password   (read   by   the
            create-node-ssh(1),   install-node(1),  install-node-
            ssh(1), and update-node-ssh(1) subcommands)

          o AS_ADMIN_SSHKEYPASSPHRASE=sshd-passphrase  (read   by
            the   create-node-ssh(1),  install-node(1),  install-
            node-ssh(1), and update-node-ssh(1) subcommands)

          o AS_ADMIN_JMSDBPASSWORD=jdbc-user-password  (read   by
            the configure-jms-cluster(1) subcommand)

     These password entries are stored in clear text in the pass-
     word  file.  To  provide  additional  security,  the create-
     password-alias subcommand can be used to create aliases  for
     passwords  that are used by remote subcommands. The password
     for which the alias is created is  stored  in  an  encrypted
     form. If an alias exists for a password, the alias is speci-
     fied in the entry for the password as follows:
     AS_ADMIN_password-name=${ALIAS=password-alias-name}

     For example:
     AS_ADMIN_SSHPASSWORD=${ALIAS=ssh-password-alias}
     AS_ADMIN_SSHKEYPASSPHRASE=${ALIAS=ssh-key-passphrase-alias}

     In domains that do  not  allow  unauthenticated  login,  all
     remote  subcommands must specify the administration password
     to authenticate to the DAS. The password can be specified by
     one of the following means:

          o Through the --passwordfile option

          o Through the login(1) subcommand

          o Interactively at the command prompt

Utility Commands                                      asadmin(1m)

     The login  subcommand  can  be  used  to  specify  only  the
     administration  password.  For  other  passwords that remote
     subcommands  require,  use  the  --passwordfile  option   or
     specify them at the command prompt.

     After authenticating to a domain by using the asadmin  login
     command,  you  need  not specify the administration password
     through the --passwordfile option for subsequent  operations
     on the domain. However, only the AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is
     not required. You still must provide  the  other  passwords,
     for example, AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by indivi-
     dual subcommands, such as update-file-user(1).

     For security reasons, a password that  is  specified  as  an
     environment variable is not read by the asadmin utility.

     The master password is not propagated on the command line or
     an  environment  variable,  but can be specified in the file
     that the --passwordfile option specifies.

     The default value for AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --terse , -t
          If true, output data is very concise and  in  a  format
          that  is  optimized  for  use in scripts instead of for
          reading by  humans.  Typically,  descriptive  text  and
          detailed status messages are also omitted from the out-
          put data. Default is false.

     --secure , -s
          If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to  communicate  with  the
          DAS.

          The default is false.

     --echo , -e
          If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed on
          the standard output. Default is false.

     --interactive , -I
          If set to true, only the required options are prompted.

          The default depends on how the asadmin utility is run:

          o If the asadmin utility is run from a console  window,
            the default is true.

          o If the asadmin utility is run without a console  win-
            dow,  for  example, from within a script, the default
            is false.

     single  mode.  In  this  example, the default values for all
     options are used.

     The example shows that the application hello is deployed  on
     the local host.
     asadmin list-applications
     hello <web>
     Command list-applications executed successfully.
     Example 2 Specifying an asadmin Utility Option With  a  Sub-
     command

     This example specifies the --hostasadmin utility option with
     the  list-applications  subcommand  in  single mode. In this
     example, the DAS is running on the host srvr1.example.com.

     The example shows that the applications basic-ezcomp, scrum-
     toys, ejb31-war, and automatic-timer-ejb are deployed on the
     host srvr1.example.com.
     asadmin --host srvr1.example.com list-applications
     basic-ezcomp <web>

Utility Commands                                      asadmin(1m)

     For the UNIX operating system in single mode and  multimode,
     and  for  all  operating systems in multimode, the backslash
     (\) is required to escape the backslash (\)  meta  character
     and the colon (:) option delimiter:
     asadmin deploy --property extras.home='c\:\\extras\\pmdapp' pmdapp.war
     Application deployed with name pmdapp.
     Command deploy executed successfully
     For the Windows operating system in single mode, the  single
     quote  (')  characters  eliminate  the need for other escape
     characters:
     asadmin deploy --property extras.home='c:\extras\pmdapp' pmdapp.war
     Application deployed with name pmdapp.
     Command deploy executed successfully
     Example 5 Specifying a UNIX Operating System Meta  Character
     in an Option

     The commands in this example specify the backslash (\)  UNIX
     operating  system  meta  character  in  the  option argument
     Test\Escape\Character.

     For the UNIX operating system in single mode and  multimode,
     and  for  all  operating systems in multimode, the backslash
     (\) is required to escape the backslash (\) meta character:
     asadmin --user admin --passwordfile gfpass create-jdbc-connection-pool
     --datasourceclassname sampleClassName
     --description Test\\Escape\\Character
     sampleJDBCConnectionPool
     For the Windows operating system in single mode,  no  escape
     character is required:
     asadmin --user admin --passwordfile gfpass create-jdbc-connection-pool
     --datasourceclassname sampleClassName
     --description Test\Escape\Character
     sampleJDBCConnectionPool
     Example 6 Specifying a Command-Line Argument That Contains a
     Space

     The commands in this example specify spaces in  the  operand
     C:\Documents and Settings\gfuser\apps\hello.war.

     For all operating systems in single mode or  multimode,  the
     entire  operand  can be enclosed in double quote (") charac-
     ters:
     asadmin deploy "C:\Documents and Settings\gfuser\apps\hello.war"
     Application deployed with name hello.
     Command deploy executed successfully.
     For the UNIX operating system in single mode and  multimode,
     and  for  all  operating  systems  in  multimode, the entire
     command-line argument can be enclosed in  single  quote  (')

     Alternatively, for the UNIX operating system in single  mode
     and  multimode,  and for all operating systems in multimode,
     the backslash (\) escape character can be used  before  each
     space  in  the operand. In this situation, the backslash (\)
     escape character is required before each  backslash  in  the
     operand:
     asadmin> deploy C:\\Documents\ and\ Settings\\gfuser\\apps\\hello.war
     Application deployed with name hello.
     Command deploy executed successfully.
     Example 7 Specifying a Meta Character and an  Option  Delim-
     iter Character in a Property

     The commands in this example specify the backslash (\)  UNIX
     operating  system  meta  character  and the colon (:) option
     delimiter character in the --property option of the  create-
     jdbc-connection-pool(1) subcommand.

     The name and value pairs for the --property  option  are  as
     follows:
     user=dbuser
     passwordfile=dbpasswordfile
     DatabaseName=jdbc:derby
     server=http://localhost:9092
     For the UNIX operating system in single mode and  multimode,
     and  for all operating systems in multimode, a backslash (\)
     is required to escape the colon (:) and the backslash (\):
     asadmin --user admin --passwordfile gfpass create-jdbc-connection-pool
     --datasourceclassname com.derby.jdbc.jdbcDataSource
     --property user=dbuser:passwordfile=dbpasswordfile:
     DatabaseName=jdbc\\:derby:server=http\\://localhost\\:9092 javadb-pool
     Alternatively, the entire argument to the --property  option
     can be enclosed in single quote (') characters:
     asadmin --user admin --passwordfile gfpass create-jdbc-connection-pool
     --datasourceclassname com.derby.jdbc.jdbcDataSource
     --property 'user=dbuser:passwordfile=dbpasswordfile:
     DatabaseName="jdbc:derby":server="http://localhost:9092"' javadb-pool
     For the Windows operating system in single mode, a backslash
     (\)  is  required  to escape only the colon (:), but not the
     backslash (\):
     asadmin --user admin --passwordfile gfpass create-jdbc-connection-pool
     --datasourceclassname com.derby.jdbc.jdbcDataSource
     --property user-dbuser:passwordfile-dbpasswordfile:
     DatabaseName=jdbc\:derby:server=http\://localhost\:9092 javadb-pool
     For all operating systems, the need to escape the colon  (:)
     in  a  value can be avoided by enclosing the value in double
     quote characters or single quote characters:
     asadmin --user admin --passwordfile gfpass create-jdbc-connection-pool
     --datasourceclassname com.derby.jdbc.jdbcDataSource
     --property user=dbuser:passwordfile=dbpasswordfile:
     DatabaseName=\"jdbc:derby\":server=\"http://localhost:9092\" javadb-pool
     Example 8 Specifying an Option Delimiter and an Escape Char-
     acter in a JVM Machine Option

Java EE 6            Last change: 6 Jan 2012                   11

Utility Commands                                      asadmin(1m)

     The commands in this example specify the  following  charac-
     ters in the -Dlocation=c:\sun\appserver JVM machine option:

     o The colon (:) option delimiter

     o The backslash (\) escape character

     For the UNIX operating system in single mode and  multimode,
     and for all operating systems in multimode, these characters
     must be specified as follows:

     o To  pass  a  literal  backslash  to  a   subcommand,   two
       backslashes are required. Therefore, the colon (:) must be
       escaped by two backslashes (\\).

     o To prevent the subcommand from treating the backslash as a
       special  character,  the  backslash  must be escaped. As a
       result, two literal backslashes (\\) must be passed to the
       subcommand.  To  prevent the shell from interpreting these
       backslashes as special characters, each backslash must  be
       escaped.  Therefore,  the backslash must be specified by a
       total of four backslashes (\\\\).

     The resulting command is as follows:
     asadmin create-jvm-options --target test-server
     -e -Dlocation=c\\:\\\\sun\\\\appserver
     For the Windows operating system in single mode, a backslash
     (\)  is  required  to escape the colon (:) and the backslash
     (\):
     asadmin create-jvm-options --target test-server
     -e -Dlocation=c\:\\sun\\appserver
     Example 9 Specifying an Option That Contains an Escape Char-
     acter

     The commands in this example specify the backslash (\) char-
     acter   and   the   double   quote  (")  characters  in  the
     "Hello\App"\authentication option argument.

     For the UNIX operating system in single mode and  multimode,
     and  for all operating systems in multimode, a backslash (\)
     is required to escape the double quote character (") and the
     backslash (\):
     asadmin set-web-env-entry --name="Hello User" --type=java.lang.String
     --value=techscribe --description=\"Hello\\App\"\\authentication hello
     For the Windows operating system in single mode, a backslash
     (\) is required to escape only the double quote ("), but not
     the backslash (\):
     asadmin set-web-env-entry --name="Hello User" --type=java.lang.String
     --value=techscribe --description=\"Hello\App\"\authentication hello
