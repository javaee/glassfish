asadmin Utility Subcommands;             change-admin-password(1)

NAME
     change-admin-password - changes the administrator password

SYNOPSIS
     change-admin-password [--help]
     [--domaindir domain-root-dir [--domain_name domain-name]]

DESCRIPTION
     The change-admin-password subcommand modifies  the  adminis-
     trator  password.  The  change-admin-password  subcommand is
     interactive because the subcommand prompts the user for  the
     old  administrator password, for the new administrator pass-
     word, and for confirmation of the  new  administrator  pass-
     word. The new password must contain at least 8 characters.

     If the only user is an anonymous user  without  a  password,
     this subcommand fails.

     If a blank password is provided, this  subcommand  fails  if
     secure administration is enabled.

     For security  purposes,  create  a  password-protected  user
     account   with  administrator  privileges.  To  create  this
     account, use the create-file-user(1) or  the  Administration
     Console.  After  creating  this  user  account,  remove  the
     anonymous user to restrict access to GlassFish  Server  set-
     tings.

     If more than one administrator is configured  for  GlassFish
     Server,  you  must  run  the asadmin command with the --user
     option to change the password for that user. For more infor-
     mation, see the examples in this help page.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode and remote  mode.
     When  the --domaindir option is specified, the change-admin-
     password subcommand operates in local  mode;  otherwise,  it
     operates in remote mode.

OPTIONS
     --help , -?
          Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --domaindir
          Specifies the parent directory of the domain  specified
          in  the --domain_name option. When this option is used,
          the change-admin-password subcommand operates in  local
          mode.

     --domain_name
          Specifies the domain of the admin user.
