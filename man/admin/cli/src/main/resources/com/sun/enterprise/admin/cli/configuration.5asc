NAME
     configuration - the data set that determines how  Enterprise
     Server operates

DESCRIPTION
     The configuration of Enterprise Server is the data set  that
     determines  how  it  operates.  Parts  of this configuration
     determine the operation  of  specific  parts  of  Enterprise
     Server, such as the following:

         o    Services, such as the transaction service

         o    Resources, such as databases

         o    Deployed  applications  or  modules,  such  as  web
              applications

     The term configuration is also used to describe  a  part  of
     the  overall  configuration, such as the transaction service
     configuration or the configuration of a database.

     Examples of configuration data are port numbers, flags  that
     enable  or  disable processes, application names, and so on.
     Most of these  data  points  are  name/value  pairs,  either
     hard-coded attributes or more flexibly defined properties.

     The hierarchical structure of the configuration is explained
     in  the  dotted  names page. You can view and change most of
     the  Enterprise  Server  configuration  using   either   the
     Administration  Console  or the asadmin utility and its sub-
     commands. To list the structure of all or part of the confi-
     guration,  use the list subcommand. To view the value of one
     or more attributes or properties, use the get subcommand. To
     change  the  value  of an attribute or property, use the set
     subcommand.

     Most of the Enterprise Server configuration is stored in the
     domain.xml  file.  For  full  details about the structure of
     this file, see the Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v3 Domain
     File Format Reference.
