asadmin Utility Subcommands                       start-domain(1)

NAME
     start-domain - starts a domain

SYNOPSIS
     start-domain [--help] [--domaindir domain-dir] [--verbose={true|false}]
     [ --debug ={true|false}] [--upgrade={true|false}] [domain-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The start-domain subcommand starts the specified domain.  If
     the  domain  directory  is  not specified, the domain in the
     default as-install/glassfish/domains directory  is  started.
     If  there  are  two or more domains, the domain-name operand
     must be specified.

     Note -

       On the Mac OS X platform, processes can bind to  the  same
       port. To avoid this problem, do not start multiple domains
       with the same port number at the same time.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.
