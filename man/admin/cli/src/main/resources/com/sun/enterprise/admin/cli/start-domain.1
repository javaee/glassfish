asadmin Utility Subcommands                       start-domain(1)

NAME
     start-domain - starts a domain

SYNOPSIS
     start-domain [--help] [--debug ={true|false}] [--domaindir domaindir]
      [--upgrade={true|false}] [--verbose={true|false}] [domain_name]

DESCRIPTION
     The start-domain subcommand starts the specified domain.  If
     the  domain  directory  is  not specified, the domain in the
     default domains directory is started. If there  are  two  or
     more domains, the domain_name operand must be specified.

     Note -

       On the Windows platform, processes can bind  to  the  same
       port. To avoid this problem, do not start multiple domains
       with the same port number at the same time.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --debug
         If set to true, the server is started in debug mode  and
         prints the JPDA port on the console. Default is false.

     --domaindir

         Specifies the directory where the domain to  be  started
         is located. If specified, the path must be accessible in
         the file system. If not specified,  the  domain  in  the
         default   install-dir/glassfish/domains   directory   is
         started.

     --verbose
     -v
         If set to true, a console  window  is  opened  in  which
         detailed  server  startup  messages and log messages are
         displayed until the server is started.  If the domain is
         later  restarted by using the restart-domain subcommand,
         issued from a different console  window,  messages  con-
         tinue  to  be  displayed in the original console window.

         You can kill the server by  typing CTRL-C, or by getting
         a  thread  dump  for  the  server by typing CTRL-\fR  on
         UNIXTM  systems,  or  CTRL-Break  on  Windows   systems.
         Default is false.

     --upgrade

         If set to true, the server is upgraded from  a  previous
         release.  The  server  is  started, the configuration is
         modified to be compatible with this  release  of  Enter-
         prise  Server,  and the server process stops.  Normally,
         if the start-domain subcommand detects that  the  confi-
         guration is from an older release of  Enterprise Server,
         the  domain  is  upgraded  automatically  before   being
         started.  You  should not need to use this option expli-
         citly. Default is false.

OPERANDS
     domain_name         The unique name of the domain  you  want
                         to  start. Default is the name specified
                         during installation, usually domain1.
