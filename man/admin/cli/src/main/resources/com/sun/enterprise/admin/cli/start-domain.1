asadmin Utility Subcommands                       start-domain(1)

NAME
     start-domain - starts the DAS of the specified domain

SYNOPSIS
     start-domain [--help] [--debug={true|false}] [--domaindir domain-dir]
     [--upgrade={true|false}] [--verbose={true|false}] [domain-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The start-domain subcommand starts the domain administration
     server  (DAS)  of  the  specified domain. If a domain is not
     specified, the default domain is  assumed.  If  the  domains
     directory  contains  two  or  more  domains, the domain-name
     operand must be specified.

     Note

     On the Windows platform, processes  can  bind  to  the  same
     port.  To  avoid this problem, do not start multiple domains
     with the same port number at the same time.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

     Note

     In Oracle  GlassFish  Server,  the  start-domain  subcommand
     prompts  for  a  new  admin user password if no password has
     been set for the admin user. Additionally,  the  admin  user
     password  must  not  be  blank  if  secure administration is
     enabled; otherwise, the start-domain subcommand fails.

     To provide the new admin user password, you can use  the  --
     passwordfile utility option of the asadmin(1M) command after
     adding the entry AS_ADMIN_NEWPASSWORD to the password file.

OPTIONS
     --help , -?
          Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --debug
          Specifies whether the domain is started with Java Plat-
          form         Debugger        Architecture        (JPDA)
          (http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/toolsapis/jpda/)
          debugging enabled.

          Possible values are as follows:

          true The  instance  is  started  with  JPDA   debugging
               enabled  and the port number for JPDA debugging is
               displayed.

          false

asadmin Utility Subcommands                       start-domain(1)

               The instance is started with JPDA  debugging  dis-
               abled (default).

     --domaindir
          The domain root directory, which contains the directory
          of  the  domain  that is to be restarted. If specified,
          the path must be accessible in  the  file  system.  The
          default  location  of  the domain root directory is as-
          install/domains.

     --upgrade
          Specifies  whether  the  configuration  of  the  domain
          administration  server (DAS) is upgraded to the current
          release. Normally, if the subcommand detects  that  the
          configuration  is  from  an  older release of GlassFish
          Server, the  configuration  is  upgraded  automatically
          before  being  started. You should not need to use this
          option explicitly.

          Possible values are as follows:

          true When the domain is started, the  configuration  is
               modified  to  be  compatible  with this release of
               GlassFish Server, and the GlassFish Server process
               stops.

          false
               The  configuration  of  the  DAS  is  not  updated
               (default).

     --verbose , -v
          Specifies whether detailed information about the domain
          is displayed in the console window where the subcommand
          is run.

          Possible values are as follows:

          true Detailed startup messages and log  messages  about
               the  domain  are  displayed  in the console window
               where the subcommand is  run.  If  the  domain  is
               later  restarted  by running the restart-domain(1)
               subcommand from a different console  window,  mes-
               sages  continue  to  be  displayed in the original
               console window.

               You can kill the GlassFish Server process by  typ-
               ing CTRL-C in the console window.

               You can kill  the  GlassFish  Server  process  and
               obtain  a thread dump for the server by typing one
