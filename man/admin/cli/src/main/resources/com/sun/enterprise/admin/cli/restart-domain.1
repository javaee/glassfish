asadmin Utility Subcommands                     restart-domain(1)

NAME
     restart-domain - restarts the DAS of the specified domain

SYNOPSIS
     restart-domain [--help] [--domaindir domaindir] [domain_name]

DESCRIPTION
     The restart-domain subcommand stops and  then  restarts  the
     Domain  Administration Server (DAS) of the specified domain.
     If a domain is not specified, the default domain is assumed.
     If  there  are  two or more domains, the domain_name operand
     must be specified. If the server is not already running, the
     subcommand attempts to restart it.

     The restart-domain subcommand does not exit until  the  sub-
     command  has  verified  that the domain has been stopped and
     restarted.

     This subcommand is supported in local or remote mode. If you
     specify  a host name, the subcommand assumes you are operat-
     ing in remote mode, which means you must correctly authenti-
     cate  to  the  remote server. In local mode, you normally do
     not need to authenticate to the server as long  as  you  are
     running  the  subcommand  as  the  same user who started the
     server.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --domaindir
         The directory of the domain that is to be restarted.  If
         specified,  the path must be accessible in the file sys-
         tem. If not specified, the domain  in  the  default  as-
         install/glassfish/domains directory is restarted.

OPERANDS
     domain_name         The name of the domain you want to  res-
                         tart. Default is the name specified dur-
                         ing installation, usually domain1.
