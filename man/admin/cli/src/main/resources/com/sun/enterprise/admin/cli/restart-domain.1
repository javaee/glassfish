asadmin Utility Subcommands                     restart-domain(1)

NAME
     restart-domain - restarts the DAS of the specified domain

SYNOPSIS
     restart-domain [--help] [--debug ={true|false}]
     [--domaindir domaindir] [domain-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The restart-domain subcommand stops and  then  restarts  the
     domain  administration server (DAS) of the specified domain.
     If a domain is not specified, the default domain is assumed.
     If  the  domains directory contains two or more domains, the
     domain-name operand must be specified. If  the  DAS  is  not
     already running, the subcommand attempts to start it.

     The restart-domain subcommand does not exit until  the  sub-
     command  has  verified  that the domain has been stopped and
     restarted.

     This subcommand is supported in local or remote mode. If you
     specify  a host name, the subcommand assumes you are operat-
     ing in remote mode, which means you must correctly authenti-
     cate  to  the  remote server. In local mode, you normally do
     not need to authenticate to the server as long  as  you  are
     running  the  subcommand  as  the  same user who started the
     server.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --debug
         Specifies whether the  domain  is  restarted  with  Java
         Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) debugging enabled.

         Possible values are as follows:

         true

             The domain is restarted with JPDA debugging  enabled
             and the port number for JPDA debugging is displayed.

         false
             The domain is restarted with JPDA debugging disabled
             (default).
