asadmin Utility Subcommands                     restart-domain(1)

NAME
     restart-domain - restarts the DAS of the specified domain

SYNOPSIS
     restart-domain [--help] [--domaindir domain-dir] [domain-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The restart-domain subcommand stops and  then  restarts  the
     Domain  Administration Server (DAS) of the specified domain.
     If a domain is not specified, the default domain is assumed.
     If  there  are  two or more domains, the domain-name operand
     must be specified. If the server is not already running, you
     are asked if you want to start it.

     The restart-domain subcommand does not exit until  the  sub-
     command  has  verified  that the domain has been stopped and
     restarted.

     A domain can also be restarted  by  using  the  start-domain
     subcommand  with  the  --verbose option set to true. In this
     situation, after the domain is restarted, messages  continue
     to  be  displayed in the console window that was opened when
     the domain was originally started.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --domaindir
         The directory of the domain that is to be restarted.  If
         specified,  the path must be accessible in the file sys-
         tem. If not specified, the domain  in  the  default  as-
         install/glassfish/domains directory is restarted.

OPERANDS
     domain-name         The name of the domain you want to  res-
                         tart. Default is the name specified dur-
                         ing installation, usually domain1.
