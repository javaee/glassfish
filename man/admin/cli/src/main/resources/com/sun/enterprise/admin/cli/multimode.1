asadmin Utility Subcommands                          multimode(1)

NAME
     multimode - allows multiple  subcommands  to  be  run  while
     preserving environment settings and remaining in the asadmin
     utility

SYNOPSIS
     multimode [--help] [--file filename] [--printprompt={true|false}] [--encoding encode]

DESCRIPTION
     The  multimode  subcommand  processes  asadmin   subcommands
     sequentially in a single session. The command-line interface
     prompts for a subcommand, runs that subcommand, displays the
     results  of  that  subcommand, and then prompts for the next
     subcommand. All the asadmin options set in  multimode  apply
     to  subsequent  commands  until  the  multimode  session  is
     exited. You exit multimode by typing exit, quit, or Ctrl-D.

     You can use the export subcommand to set  your  environment,
     or  use the unset subcommand to remove environment variables
     from the multimode environment. You can also provide subcom-
     mands  by  passing a previously prepared list of subcommands
     from a file or standard input (pipe).

     You can invoke multimode from within  a  multimode  session.
     When  you  exit the second multimode environment, you return
     to your original multimode environment.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --file filename
         Reads the subcommands as defined in filename.

     --printprompt

         Allows the printing of the  asadmin  prompt  after  each
         subcommand  is  run.  Set  this option to false when the
         commands are piped or redirected from the standard input
         or file. By default the option is set to true.
