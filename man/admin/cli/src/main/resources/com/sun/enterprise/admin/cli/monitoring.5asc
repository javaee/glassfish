NAME
     monitoring - reviewing the runtime state of  components  and
     services deployed in Enterprise Server

DESCRIPTION
     Monitoring is the process of reviewing the statistics  of  a
     system to improve performance or solve problems. By monitor-
     ing the state of various components and services deployed in
     Enterprise  Server,  performance  bottlenecks can be identi-
     fied, failures can be anticipated, and runtime standards can
     be established and observed. Data gathered by monitoring can
     also be useful in performance tuning and capacity planning.

     The Enterprise  Server  monitoring  service  is  enabled  by
     default,  that  is,  the monitoring-enabled attribute of the
     monitoring-service element is set to true. Once the monitor-
     ing  service  is  enabled,  a  deployed  module  can then be
     enabled for monitoring by setting its  monitoring  level  to
     HIGH  or  LOW (default is OFF). Monitoring can be configured
     dynamically by  using  the  Administration  Console  or  the
     enable-monitoring  and  the  disable-monitoring subcommands.
     The set subcommand can also be used  with  dotted  names  to
     enable  or  disable monitoring. However, a server restart is
     required for changes made by using  the  set  subcommand  to
     take affect.

     Monitoring data can be viewed by  using  the  Administration
     Console or by using the subcommands of the asadmin utility.

         o    The monitor subcommand displays monitoring data for
              a  given type, similar to the UNIX top command. The
              data is presented at given intervals.

         o    The list and get subcommands display  comprehensive
              data.  Both use dotted names to specify monitorable
              objects.

     Alternate tools for monitoring Enterprise Server  components
     and services include JConsole and the REST interface.

     The Monitoring Scripting Client or DTrace Monitoring can  be
     used  to  start the available monitoring probes. Using these
     tools is helpful in identifying  performance  issues  during
     runtime.  Monitoring  Scripting  Client or DTrace Monitoring
     are only usable if their modules are present.
