NAME
     monitor - displays monitoring data for  commonly  used  com-
     ponents and services

SYNOPSIS
     monitor [--help]

DESCRIPTION
     The monitor subcommand displays statistics for commonly mon-
     itored  GlassFishTM  Server  components and services. The --
     type option must be used to specify  the  object  for  which
     statistics  are  to be displayed. Data is displayed continu-
     ously in a tabular form, or the data can be displayed  at  a
     particular time interval by using the --interval option.

     Before a given component or service can be monitored,  moni-
     toring  must  be  enabled  (set to HIGH or LOW) for the com-
     ponent or service by using the Administration  Console,  the
     enable-monitoring subcommand, or the set subcommand.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.
