NAME
     monitor - displays monitoring data for  commonly  used  com-
     ponents and services

SYNOPSIS
     monitor [--help]
     --type type
     [--filename filename]
     [--interval interval]
     [--filter filter]
     instance-name

DESCRIPTION
     The monitor subcommand displays statistics for commonly mon-
     itored Enterprise Server components and services. The --type
     option must be used to specify the object for which  statis-
     tics  are to be displayed. Data is displayed continuously in
     a tabular form, or the data can be displayed at a particular
     time interval by using the --interval option.

     Before a given component or service can be monitored,  moni-
     toring  must  be  enabled  (set to HIGH or LOW) for the com-
     ponent or service by using the Administration  Console,  the
     enable-monitoring subcommand, or the set subcommand.

     This subcommand is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --type
         The component or service  to  monitor.  This  option  is
         required. No default value is defined.

             service.module-monitoring-levels.http-service   must
             be set to LOW or HIGH.

             Displays  the  following  statistics  for  the  HTTP

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
