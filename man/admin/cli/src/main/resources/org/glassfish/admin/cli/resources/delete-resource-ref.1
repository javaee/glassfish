asadmin Utility Subcommands                delete-resource-ref(1)

NAME
     delete-resource-ref - removes a reference to a resource

SYNOPSIS
     delete-resource-ref [--help] [--target target] reference_name

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-resource-ref subcommand removes a reference  from
     a  cluster  or  an unclustered server instance to a resource
     (for example, a JDBC resource). This effectively results  in
     the  removal  of the resource from the JNDI tree of the tar-
     geted instance or cluster.

     The target instance or instances making up the cluster  need
     not  be running or available for this subcommand to succeed.
     If one or more instances are not  available,  they  will  no
     longer load the resource in the JNDI tree the next time they
     start.

     Removal of the reference does not result in removal  of  the
     resource  from  the  domain. The resource is removed only by
     the  delete  subcommand  for  that  resource  (for  example,
     delete-jdbc-resource).

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     reference_name

         The name or JNDI name of the resource.
