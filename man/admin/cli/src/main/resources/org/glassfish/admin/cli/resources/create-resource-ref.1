asadmin Utility Subcommands                create-resource-ref(1)

NAME
     create-resource-ref - creates a reference to a resource

SYNOPSIS
     create-resource-ref
     [--help]
     [--target target]
     [--enabled={false|true}]
     reference_name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-resource-ref subcommand creates a reference  from
     a  cluster or an unclustered server instance to a previously
     created resource (for example, a JDBC resource created using
     the   create-jdbc-resource   subcommand).  This  effectively
     results in the resource being made  available  in  the  JNDI
     tree of the targeted instance or cluster.

     The target instance or instances making up the cluster  need
     not  be running or available for this subcommand to succeed.
     If one or  more  instances  are  not  available,  they  will
     receive the new resource the next time they start.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --enabled

         Indicates whether the resource should be  enabled.  This
         value  will  take effect only if the resource is enabled
         at the global level. The default is true.
