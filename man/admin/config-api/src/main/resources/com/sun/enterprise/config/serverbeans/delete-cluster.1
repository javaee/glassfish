NAME
     delete-cluster - deletes a cluster

SYNOPSIS
     delete-cluster
     [--help]
      [ --autohadboverride ={true|false}]
      cluster_name

DESCRIPTION
     Note -

       This command is available only in domains that are config-
       ured to support clusters, such as domains that are created
       with the cluster profile or the  enterprise  profile.  For
       information about profiles, see Usage Profiles in Sun Java
       System Application Server 9.1 Administration Guide.

     The delete-cluster command deletes a cluster. A cluster  can
     be deleted only if it contains no server instances. Stop and
     delete all server instances in the cluster  before  deleting
     the cluster.

     If a standalone cluster is deleted (that is,  the  cluster's
     configuration name is cluster_name-config and no other clus-
     ters or unclustered instances refer to this  configuration),
     then  its standalone configuration is automatically deleted.
     If HADB is installed and is being used,, the  HADB  database
     associated with a cluster can also be deleted when the clus-
     ter is deleted, depending upon the cluster's  autohadb  set-
     ting  and  whether  you  override  it  using  this command's
     autohadboverride option.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --autohadboverride
         This option is  valid  only  if  the  HADB  software  is
         installed.   The   autohadboverride   option  determines
         whether  to  override  the  cluster's  setting  for  the
         autohadb  option.  When  the  cluster  was  created, the
         autohadb option was  set  to  signal  whether  the  HADB

         database  associated  with the cluster would be started,
         stopped,  or  deleted  when  the  cluster  was  started,
         stopped,  or  deleted.  You  can  override this value by
         using the autohadboverride option.  If  autohadboverride
         is  set  to  true, the HADB database is deleted when the
         cluster is deleted. If set to false, the  HADB  database
         is  not  deleted  when  the  cluster  is deleted. If the
         autohadboverride option is not set, the  default  is  to
         use the cluster's autohadb setting.

OPERANDS
