NAME
     delete-cluster - deletes a GlassFish Server cluster

SYNOPSIS
     delete-cluster [--help] [--autohadboverride={true|false}]
     cluster-name

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-cluster subcommand  deletes  a  GlassFish  Server
     cluster.  A  cluster can be deleted only if the cluster con-
     tains no GlassFish Server instances. If a cluster  that  you
     are  deleting  contains  any  instances, stop and delete the
     instances before deleting the cluster.

     If no other clusters or unclustered instances refer  to  the
     cluster's  named configuration, the configuration is deleted
     when the cluster is deleted.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --autohadboverride
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command runs successfully and the option is ignored.

OPERANDS

         The name of the cluster to delete.
