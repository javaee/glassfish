DESCRIPTION
     The create-cluster subcommand  creates  a  GlassFish  Server
     cluster.  Initially the cluster contains no GlassFish Server
     instances, applications, or resources.

     A cluster requires a reference to  the  named  configuration
     that  defines  the  configuration  of all instances that are
     added to the cluster. The configuration can be specified  in
     the  command  to create the cluster, but is not required. If
     no configuration is specified, the subcommand creates a con-
     figuration  that  is named cluster-name-config for the clus-
     ter. The cluster that is created  is  a  standalone  cluster
     because  the  cluster's configuration is not shared with any
     other clusters or standalone instances.

     To add instances to the cluster, set the --cluster option to
     the  name  of the cluster when using either of the following
     subcommands:

         o    create-instance(1)

         o    create-local-instance(1)

     To delete server instances from the cluster at any time, use
     one of the following subcommands:

         o    delete-instance(1)

         o    delete-local-instance(1)

     To associate applications and resources with  all  instances
     in  the  cluster, set the --target option to the name of the
     cluster when performing the following operations:

         o    Deploying applications by using the deploy(1)  sub-
              command

         o    Creating resources by  using  subcommands  such  as
              create-jdbc-resource(1)

         o    Creating  references  to  applications   that   are
              already  deployed  in  other  targets  by using the
              create-application-ref(1) subcommand

         o    Creating references to resources that  are  already
              created  in  other  targets  by  using  the create-
              resource-ref(1) subcommand

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --config
         Specifies  the  named  configuration  that  the  cluster
         references. The configuration must exist and must not be
         named default-config or server-config. If the configura-
         tion name specifies a standalone configuration, an error
         occurs. Specifying the --config option creates a  shared
         cluster.   If this option is omitted, a standalone clus-
         ter is created.

     --systemproperties

         Defines system properties for the configuration that  is
         created  for  the cluster. These properties override the
         property values in the default-config configuration. The
         following properties are available:

         ASADMIN_LISTENER_PORT
             This property specifies the port number of the  HTTP
             port or the HTTPS port for administration. This port
             is the port in the URL that you specify in your  web
             browser   to   manage  the  instance,  for  example,
             http://localhost:4949. Valid values are 1-65535.  On
             UNIX,  creating  sockets that listen on ports 1-1024

             requires superuser privileges.

         OSGI_SHELL_TELNET_PORT

             This property specifies the port number of the  port
             that  is  used  for  connections to the Apache Felix
             Remote Shell. This shell uses the Felix  shell  ser-
             vice  to  interact  with the OSGi  module management
             subsystem. Valid values are 1-65535. On UNIX, creat-
             ing  sockets  that  listen  on ports 1-1024 requires
             superuser privileges.

     --properties
         Defines properties for the cluster. The  following  pro-
         perties are available:

         GMS_LISTENER_PORT

             The port number of the port  on  which  the  cluster
             listens  for messages from the Group Management Ser-
             vice (GMS). The default value should suffice in most
             situations.

         GMS_LOOPBACK
             Specifies  whether  an  instance  may  receive  from
             itself  application-level messages that the instance
             broadcasts to the cluster.

             Possible values are as follows:

             false

                 The  instance  may  not  receive  messages  from
                 itself (default).

             true

                 The instance may receive messages  from  itself.
                 Use  this  setting  for testing an instance when
                 the instance is the only instance in a cluster.

         GMS_MULTICAST_TIME_TO_LIVE
             The maximum number of  iterations  or  transmissions
             that  a multicast message for the following types of
             events can experience before  the  message  is  dis-
             carded:

                 o    Group discovery

                 o    Member heartbeats

                 o    Membership changes
             To match the configuration of the network  on  which
             the  DAS  and  clustered instances are deployed, set
             this value as low  as  possible.  To  determine  the
             lowest  possible  value  for  your  system,  use the
             validate-multicast(1) subcommand.

             A value of 0 ensures that multicast  messages  never
             leave the host from which they are broadcast.

             A value of 1 might prevent the broadcast of messages
             between hosts on same subnet that are connected by a
             switch or a router.

             The default is 4, which ensures  that  messages  are
             successfully  broadcast  to  all  cluster members in
             networks where hosts are connected  by  switches  or
             routers.

     --gmsenabled

         Specifies whether GMS is enabled for the cluster.

         Possible values are as follows:

         true
             GMS is enabled for the cluster (default).

             When GMS is enabled for a cluster, GMS is started in
             each  server instance in the cluster and in the DAS.
             The DAS participates in each cluster for which  this
             option is set to true.

         false

             GMS is disabled for the cluster.

     --multicastaddress
         The address on which GMS listens for group events.  This
         option  must  specify  a  multicast address in the range
         224.0.0.0  through  239.255.255.255.  The   default   is
         228.9.XX.YY, where XX and YY are automatically generated
         independent values between 0 and 255.

     --multicastport

         The port number  of  communication  port  on  which  GMS
         listens  for  group  events.  This option must specify a
         valid port number in the range 2048-32000.  The  default
         is an automatically generated value in this range.

     --bindaddress
         The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the network inter-
         face to which GMS binds. This option must specify the IP
         address of a local network interface. The default is all
         public network interface addresses.

         On a multihome machine, this option configures the  net-
         work  interface  that  used  for  the  GMS.  A multihome
         machine possesses two or more network interfaces.

         To specify an address that is valid  for  all  GlassFish
         Server  instances  in the cluster, use a system property
         to set the address individually for each instance.

         For example, use the create-system-properties subcommand
         to   create   the  system  property  GMS-BIND-INTERFACE-
         ADDRESS-cluster-name. Then set the --bindaddress  option
         of   this  subcommand  to  ${GMS-BIND-INTERFACE-ADDRESS-
         cluster-name} to specify the system  property.  Finally,
         for  each  instance  in  the  cluster, set the GMS-BIND-
         INTERFACE-ADDRESS-cluster-name system  property  to  the
         required  network  interface  address  on the instance's
         machine.

     --hosts

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command runs successfully and the option is ignored.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Creating a Cluster

     This example creates a cluster that is named ltscluster  for
     which  port  1169 is to be used for secure IIOP connections.
     Because the --config option is not  specified,  the  cluster
     references  a copy of the named configuration default-config
     that is named ltscluster-config.
