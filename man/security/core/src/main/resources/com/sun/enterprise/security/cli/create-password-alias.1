asadmin Utility Subcommands;             create-password-alias(1)

NAME
     create-password-alias - creates a password alias

SYNOPSIS
     create-password-alias [--help]
     aliasname

DESCRIPTION
     This subcommand creates an alias for a password. An alias is
     a  token  of  the form ${ALIAS=password-alias-password}. The
     password corresponding to the alias name  is  stored  in  an
     encrypted  form.  The create-password-alias subcommand takes
     both a  secure  interactive  form  (in  which  the  user  is
     prompted  for  all  information)  and a more script-friendly
     form, in which the password is  propagated  on  the  command
     line.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
