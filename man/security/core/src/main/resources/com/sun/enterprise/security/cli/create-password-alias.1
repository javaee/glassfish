NAME
     create-password-alias - creates a password alias

SYNOPSIS
     create-password-alias
     [--help]
      aliasname

DESCRIPTION
     This subcommand creates an alias for a password  and  stores
     it   in  domain.xml.  An  alias  is  a  token  of  the  form
     ${ALIAS=password-alias-password}. The password corresponding
     to  the  alias  name  is  stored  in  an encrypted form. The
     create-password-alias command takes both a  secure  interac-
     tive  form  (in  which the user is prompted for all informa-
     tion) and a more script-friendly form, in which the password
     is propagated on the command line.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
