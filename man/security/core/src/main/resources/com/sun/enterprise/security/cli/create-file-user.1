asadmin Utility Subcommands                   create-file-user(1)

NAME
     create-file-user - creates a new file user

SYNOPSIS
     create-file-user
     [--help]

      [ --authrealmname  auth_realm_name]
     [--groups user_groups[:user_groups]*]
      user_name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-file-user subcommand creates an entry in the key-
     file with the specified username, password, and groups. Mul-
     tiple groups can be created by separating them with a  colon
     (:).  If  auth_realm_name  is  not  specified,  an  entry is
     created  in  the  keyfile  for   the   default   realm.   If
     auth_realm_name  is  specified,  an  entry is created in the
     keyfile using the auth_realm_name.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --groups

         This is the group associated with this file user.

     --authrealmname
         This is the file where the file users are stored.

OPERANDS
     user_name                   This is the name of file user to
                                 be created.
