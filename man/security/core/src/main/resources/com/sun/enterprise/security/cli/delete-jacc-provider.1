asadmin Utility Subcommands               delete-jacc-provider(1)

NAME
     delete-jacc-provider  -  enables  administrators  to  delete
     JACC providers defined for a domain

SYNOPSIS
     delete-jacc-provider [--help]
     [--target target] jacc-provider-name

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-jacc-provider subcommand  enables  administrators
     to  delete JACC providers defined for a domain. JACC provid-
     ers are defined as jacc-provider elements in  the  security-
     service  element  in the domain's domain.xml file. JACC pro-
     viders can be created using the GlassFish Server Admin  Con-
     sole or the create-jacc-provider subcommand.

     The default GlassFish Server installation includes two  JACC
     providers, named default and simple. These default providers
     should not be deleted.

     Authorization modules that depend on the JACC provider to be
     deleted  should  be  reconfigured  to work with an alternate
     provider before the deletion.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     If an option has a short option name, then the short  option
     precedes  the  long option name. Short options have one dash
     whereas long options have two dashes.

     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Specifies the target from which  you  are  deleting  the
         JACC provider. The following values are valid:

         server

             Deletes the JACC  provider  on  the  default  server
             instance. This is the default value.
