asadmin Utility Subcommands;             change-admin-password(1)

NAME
     change-admin-password - changes the administrator password

SYNOPSIS
     change-admin-password [--help]

DESCRIPTION
     The change-admin-password subcommand modifies  the  adminis-
     trator  password.  The  change-admin-password  subcommand is
     interactive because the subcommand prompts the user for  the
     old  administrator password, for the new administrator pass-
     word, and for confirmation  of the new  administrator  pass-
     word. The new password must contain at least 8 characters.

     If the only user is an anonymous user  without  a  password,
     this subcommand fails.

     For security  purposes,  create  a  password-protected  user
     account   with  administrator  privileges.  To  create  this
     account, use the create-file-user(1) or  the  Administration
     Console.  After  creating  this  user  account,  remove  the
     anonymous user to restrict access to GlassFishTM Server set-
     tings.

     If more than one administrator is configured  for  GlassFish
     Server,  you  must  run  the asadmin command with the --user
     option to change the password for that user. For more infor-
     mation, see the examples in this help page.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.
