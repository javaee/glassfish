asadmin Utility Subcommands;             change-admin-password(1)

NAME
     change-admin-password - changes the administrator password

SYNOPSIS
     change-admin-password
     [--help]

DESCRIPTION
     The change-admin-password subcommand modifies  the  adminis-
     trator  password.  The  change-admin-password  subcommand is
     interactive because the subcommand prompts the user for  the
     old  administrator password, for the new administrator pass-
     word, and for confirmation  of the new  administrator  pass-
     word. The new password must contain at least 8 characters.

     If the only user in anonymous, and this user  is  not  pass-
     worded, this command will fail. For security purposes, it is
     recommended that you create a passworded user with  adminis-
     trator  privileges using the create-file-user command or the
     GlassFish Administration Console, which you  can  access  by
     opening http://localhost:4848 in a web browser. When this is
     complete, remove the anonymous user to restrict unauthorized
     access to GlassFish server settings.

     If more than one administrator is configured for  GlassFish,
     you  must start the asadmin command with the ---user option,
     as shown in the example below, to change  the  password  for
     that user.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.
