NAME
     create-jacc-provider  - enables administrators to  create  a
     JACC  provider that can be used by third-party authorization
     modules for applications running in GlassFish Server

SYNOPSIS
     create-jacc-provider [--help]
     [--policyproviderclass pol-provider-class]
     [--policyconfigfactoryclass pc-factory-class]
     [--property name=value)[:name=value]*]
     [--target  target] jacc-provider-name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-jacc-provider subcommand creates  a  JSR-115/196-
     compliant  Java Authorization Contract for Containers (JACC)
     provider that  can  be  used  by  third-party  authorization
     modules  for  applications  running in GlassFish Server. The
     JACC provider is created as a jacc-provider  element  within
     the  security-service  element  in  the  domain's domain.xml
     file.

     The default GlassFish Server installation includes two  JACC
     providers,  named  default  and  simple.  Any JACC providers
     created with  the  create-jacc-provider  subcommand  are  in
     addition to these two default providers. The default GlassF-
     ish Server JACC providers  implement  a  simple,  file-based
     authorization  engine that complies with the JACC specifica-
     tion. The create-jacc-provider subcommand makes it  possible
     to specify additional third-party JACC providers.

     All GlassFish  Server  JACC  providers  must  use  the  Java
     Authentication  and  Authorization Service (JAAS) APIs. JAAS
     enables services to authenticate and enforce access controls
     upon users. JAAS implements a Java technology version of the
     standard Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) framework.

     JSR 196 allows you to develop plugins at  different  layers.
     You  can  define plugins that change the way new authentica-
     tion mechanism are configured,  such  as  AuthConfigProvider
     and  AuthConfigFactory.  You can also define new authentica-
     tion mechanisms, such as ServerAuthModule and  ClientAuthMo-
     dule.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

     precedes  the  long option name. Short options have one dash
     whereas long options have two dashes.

     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --policyproviderclass
         Specifies  the  fully  qualified  class  name  for   the
         javax.security.jacc.policy.provider  that implements the
         java.security.Policy.

     --policyconfigfactoryclass

         Specifies  the  fully  qualified  class  name  for   the
         javax.security.jacc.PolicyConfigurationFactory.provider
         that       implements       the        provider-specific
         javax.security.jacc.PolicyConfigurationFactory.

     --property
         Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring  the
         JACC provider. The following properties are available:

         repository

             The directory containing the JACC policy  file.  For
             the  default  GlassFish  Server  JACC  provider, the
             default                 directory                 is
             ${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/generated/policy.   This
             property is not defined by default  for  the  simple
             GlassFish Server JACC provider.

     --target
         Specifies the target for which you are creating the JACC
         provider. The following values are valid:

         server

             Creates the JACC  provider  on  the  default  server
             instance. This is the default value.

         configuration_name
             Creates the JACC provider in  the  specified  confi-
             guration.
