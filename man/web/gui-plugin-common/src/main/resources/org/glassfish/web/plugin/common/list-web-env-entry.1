     deployed web application or module

              the set-web-env-entry subcommand that was specified
              when the entry was set

         context. The name must be  unique  within  a  deployment
         component.   If  this option is omitted, all environment
         entries that have previously been set for  the  applica-
         tion are listed.

         The  name  of  the  application.  The  application  must

     module-name

         The name of the module within the  application.  module-
         name  is  required only if the environment entry applies
         to a web module of a Java EE application. If  specified,
         module-name must follow application-name, separated by a
         slash (/).

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Listing Environment Entries for a Web Application

     This example lists all environment entries  that  have  been
     set  for the web application hello by using the set-web-env-
     entry subcommand. Because no description was specified  when
     the  Hello Port environment entry was set, null is displayed
     instead of a description for this entry.

       asadmin> list-web-env-entry hello
       Hello User (java.lang.String) = techscribe ignoreDescriptorItem=false
        //User authentication for Hello appplication
       Hello Port (java.lang.Integer) = null ignoreDescriptorItem=true //null

       Command list-web-env-entry executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
     0                           command executed successfully

     1                           error in executing the command
