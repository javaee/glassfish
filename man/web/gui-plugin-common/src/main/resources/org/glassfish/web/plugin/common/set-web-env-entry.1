NAME
     set-web-env-entry - sets an environment entry for a deployed
     web application or module

SYNOPSIS
     set-web-env-entry [--help]
     --name=env-entry-name --type=env-entry-type
     {--value=value|--ignoreDescriptorItem={true|false}}
     [--description=description] application-name[/module-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The set-web-env-entry subcommand sets an  environment  entry
     for one of the following items:

         o    A deployed web application

         o    A web module in a deployed  Java  Platform,  Enter-
              prise Edition (Java EE) application

     The application must  already  be  deployed.  Otherwise,  an
     error occurs.

     An application uses the values  of  environment  entries  to
     customize its behavior or presentation.

     This subcommand enables you to change the configuration of a
     deployed   application   without  the  need  to  modify  the
     application's deployment descriptors and repackage and rede-
     ploy the application.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --name
         The name of the environment entry that is to be set. The
         name  is  a JNDI name relative to the java:comp/env con-
         text. The name must be unique within a  deployment  com-
         ponent.

     --type

         The fully-qualified Java type of the  environment  entry
         value  that  is expected by the application's code. This
         type must be one of the following Java types:

             o    java.lang.Boolean

             o    java.lang.Byte

             o    java.lang.Character

             o    java.lang.Double

             o    java.lang.Float

             o    java.lang.Integer

             o    java.lang.Long

             o    java.lang.Short

             o    java.lang.String

     --value
         The value to which the environment entry is to  be  set.
         If  the --type is java.lang.Character, the value must be
         a single character.  Otherwise,  the  value  must  be  a
         string  that  is valid for the constructor of the speci-
         fied type.

         Either the --value option or the  --ignoreDescriptorItem
         option must be set.

     --ignoreDescriptorItem

         Specifies whether the environment entry is ignored if it
         is  set in the application's deployment descriptor. When
         an environment entry is ignored, the application behaves
         as  if the entry had never been set in the application's
         deployment descriptor. The behavior of an application in
         this situation depends on the application.

         The possible values are as follows:

         false
             The value is not ignored (default).

asadmin Utility Subcommands                  set-web-env-entry(1)

         true

             The value is ignored.

         Either the --value option or the  --ignoreDescriptorItem
         option must be set.

         Note -

           Do not use the --ignoreDescriptorItem option to  unset
           an  environment  entry that has previously been set by
           using the set-web-env-entry subcommand.  Instead,  use
           the  unset-web-env-entry(1)  subcommand  for this pur-
           pose.

     --description
         An optional textual description of the environment entry
         that is being set.

OPERANDS
     application-name

         The  name  of  the  application.  The  application  must
         already be deployed. Otherwise, an error occurs.

     module-name
         The name of the module within the  application.  module-
         name  is  required only if the environment entry applies
         to a web module of a Java EE application. If  specified,
         module-name must follow application-name, separated by a
         slash (/).

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Setting an Environment Entry for a Web Application

     This example sets the environment entry Hello  User  of  the
     application hello to techscribe. The Java type of this entry
     is java.lang.String.

       asadmin> set-web-env-entry --name="Hello User"
       --type=java.lang.String --value=techscribe
       --description="User authentication for Hello appplication" hello

       Command set-web-env-entry executed successfully.

     Example 2 Ignoring an Environment Entry That Is Defined in a
     Deployment Descriptor

     This example ignores the environment entry Hello Port of the
     web application hello.

       asadmin> set-web-env-entry --name="Hello Port"
       --type=java.lang.Integer --ignoreDescriptorItem=true hello

       Command set-web-env-entry executed successfully.
