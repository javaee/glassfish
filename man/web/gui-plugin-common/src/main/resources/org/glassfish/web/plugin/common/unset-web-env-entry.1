NAME
     unset-web-env-entry - unsets  an  environment  entry  for  a
     deployed web application or module

SYNOPSIS
     unset-web-env-entry [--help] --name=env-entry-name application-name[/module-name]

DESCRIPTION
     The unset-web-env-entry  subcommand  unsets  an  environment
     entry for one of the following items:

         o    A deployed web application

         o    A web module in a deployed  Java  Platform,  Enter-
              prise Edition (Java EE) application

     When an entry is unset, its value reverts to the  value,  if
     any, that is set in the application's deployment descriptor.

     The application must  already  be  deployed.  Otherwise,  an
     error occurs.

     The entry must have previously been set by  using  the  set-
     web-env-entry(1) subcommand. Otherwise, an error occurs.

     Note -

       Do not use the unset-web-env-entry  subcommand  to  change
       the  value  of  an  environment  entry  that  is set in an
       application's  deployment  descriptor.  Instead,  use  the
       set-web-env-entry subcommand for this purpose.

     This subcommand enables you to change the configuration of a
     deployed   application   without  the  need  to  modify  the
     application's deployment descriptors and repackage and rede-
     ploy the application.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

         component.  This  entry must have previously been set by
         using the set-web-env-entry  subcommand.  Otherwise,  an
         error occurs.

     module-name

         The name of the module within the  application.  module-
         name  is  required only if the environment entry applies
         to a web module of a Java EE application. If  specified,
         module-name must follow application-name, separated by a
         slash (/).
