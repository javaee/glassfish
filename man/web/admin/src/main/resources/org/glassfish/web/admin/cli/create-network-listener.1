asadmin Utility Subcommands            create-network-listener(1)

NAME
     create-network-listener - adds a new network listener socket

SYNOPSIS
     create-network-listener
     [--help]
     [ --address  address]
     --listenerport listener-port
     [--threadpool thread-pool]
     --protocol protocol
     [--transport transport]
     [--enabled={true|false}]
     [ --jkenabled ={false|true}] listener-name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-network-listener  subcommand  creates  a  network
     listener. This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

     Note -

       If you edit the  special  network  listener  named  admin-
       listener,  you  must restart the server for the changes to
       take effect. The Administration Console does not tell  you
       that a restart is required in this case.

     Note -

       You can use the create-http-listener subcommand to  create
       a  network  listener  that  uses the HTTP protocol without
       having to first create a protocol, transport, or HTTP con-
       figuration.  This subcommand is a convenient shortcut, but
       it gives access to only a limited number of options.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --address
         The IP address or the hostname (resolvable by DNS).

     --listenerport

         The port number to create the listen  socket  on.  Legal
         values  are  1-65535.  On  UNIX,  creating  sockets that
         listen on ports 1-1024  requires  superuser  privileges.
         Configuring  an  SSL listen socket to listen on port 443
         is standard.
