DESCRIPTION
     The create-http subcommand creates a set of HTTP  parameters
     for a protocol, which in turn configures one or more network
     listeners. This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --request-timeout-seconds
         The time in seconds at which the request times out.  The
         default is 30.

     --timeout-seconds

         The maximum time in seconds for which a keep alive  con-
         nection  is  kept  open. A value of 0 or less means keep
         alive  connections  are  kept  open  indefinitely.   The
         default is 30.

     --max-connection
         The maximum number of HTTP requests that  can  be  pipe-
         lined  until the connection is closed by the server. Set
         this property to 1 to disable  HTTP/1.0  keep-alive,  as
         well  as HTTP/1.1 keep-alive and pipelining. The default
         is 250.

     --default-virtual-server

         The ID attribute of the default virtual server  for  the
         associated network listeners.
