party intellectual property claims: (a) under intellectual property
rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer
to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute
the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications,
and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of
Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for
sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions
thereof). (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code
under the terms of this License. (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b)
above, no patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from
the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code; or 3) for
infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii)
the combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

2.2. Contributor Grant. Subject to third party intellectual property
claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license (a) under intellectual property rights (other than
patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce,
modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as
part of a Larger Work; and (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the
making, using, or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor
either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or
portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or
portions of such combination). (c) the licenses granted in Sections
2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first makes
Commercial Use of the Covered Code. (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b)
above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor
has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the
Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party
modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of
Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as
part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent
Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
that Contributor.


3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to
which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,
including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of
Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or
a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You
must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
additional document offering the additional rights described in Section
3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or
to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under
the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable
version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available
via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at
least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available,
or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are
responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available
even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third
party.

3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to
which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made
to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include
a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and
including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and
(b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party Claims. If
Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include
a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which
describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly

modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably

calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
knowledge has been obtained. (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's
Modifications include an application programming interface and
Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably
necessary to implement

that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL
file. (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as
disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
this License.

3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in
each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice
in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You
mustinclude such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created
one or more Modification(s) You may add yourname as a Contributor to the
notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in
any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights

or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer,
and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients ofCovered Code. However, You may
do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any
suchwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurredby the Initial Developer or
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered
Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have
been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that
theSource Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms
of this License, including a description of how and where You have
fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version
of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice,
which may contain terms different from this License,

provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or
alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights
set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version
under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any
terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
terms You offer.

3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must
make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
Code.


4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible
for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to
the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the
code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of
the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.


5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which
the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to
related Covered Code.


6. Versions of the License.

6.1. New Versions. Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'')
may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to
time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under
a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it
under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered
Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published
by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the
terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this
License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not
already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your
license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'',
''Netscape'', "MPL", ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not
appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from
this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the
license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall
not of themselves be deemed to bemodifications of this License.)


7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND

PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF
THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT
UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.


8. TERMINATION.

8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive
any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file
such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that: (a) such
Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any
patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this

License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You
either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable
reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by
such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of
notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually
agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not
withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1
and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day
notice period specified above. (b) any software, hardware, or device,
other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or
indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of
the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,
Modifications made by that Participant.

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
termination shall survive termination.


9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR
ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.


10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48
C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software''
and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are
used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212
and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.
Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set
forth herein.


11. MISCELLANEOUS.

hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in
which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or
registered to do business in the United States of America, any
litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction
of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue
lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party
responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the
language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
apply to this License.

responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out
of its utilization of rights under this Licenseand You agree to work
with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial
Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your
choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the
Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
