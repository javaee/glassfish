To run subsets of the tests do something like this:


ant clean
ant -Dteststorun=monitoring | tee out

or  
ant -Dteststorun=cluster | tee out

or  
ant -Dteststorun=restart-domain | tee out

etc.

Windows -->  start d:\bg\all\v2\appserv-tests\test_results.html
ALl Platforms --> Take a look at ../../../test_results.html in a browser.

set this to true and the tests will stop after the first failure.
It will cleanup all GF processes too.
Set as either sys prop or env variable.
