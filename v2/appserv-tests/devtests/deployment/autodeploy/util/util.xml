        This target runs a Java class that watches the app server's autodeploy directory and detects
        when the app server has deployed or undeployed the app (or has reported a failure to do so) by observing
        when the marker files appear in the directory.  
        
        The target records its results in a temporary properties file in the ${build} directory.
        This provides a simple way (relatively simple, at least) to use the same target more than once
        and store different result values in a way that can be retrieved and used from the main
        target.  (This basically works around the behavior of ant in which a called target's property
        settings are NOT propagated out to the calling target.  It also avoids the practice of creating
        a set of marker files that, by their presence or absence, convey success or failure of a substep.)

            that the output to the file being written will reside on a line by itself.  The
            left-justification is not really needed but the properties file looks a bit nicer
            if you open it in an editor.  This is because the next line in the properties file being

        To monitor auto-deployment or auto-undeployment, we start by getting the current time.  
        Then we copy the archive file into the autodeploy directory (for auto-deploy) or delete 
        it (for auto-undeploy).  All marker files created by the server during auto-deployment of
        the newly-copied archive file will have later timestamps than the timestamp just created.
        There could be earlier marker files for the same archive in the directory and the monitor 
        wants to ignore those, which is why we get the current time and pass it to the monitor.
        
        The monitor will check for marker files for the copied archive file
        and whose last modification time are after the current timestamp, returning 0 if the 
        auto-deployer creates a _deployed or _undeployed file, 1 if it creates a _deploy_failed 
        or _undeploy_failed file, and -1 if it recognized no marker file.
