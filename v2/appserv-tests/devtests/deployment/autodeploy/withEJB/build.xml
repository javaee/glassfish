    Note that this currently assumes that the ear/earwithejb and ejb/statelesshello projects have run to build

        This target runs a Java class that watches the app server's autodeploy directory and detects
        when the app server has deployed or undeployed the app (or has reported a failure to do so) by observing
        when the marker files appear in the directory.  
        
        The target records its results in a temporary properties file in the ${build} directory.
        This provides a simple way (relatively simple, at least) to use the same target more than once
        and store different result values in a way that can be retrieved and used from the main
        target.  (This basically works around the behavior of ant in which a called target's property
        settings are NOT propagated out to the calling target.  It also avoids the practice of creating
        a set of marker files that, by their presence or absence, convey success or failure of a substep.)
