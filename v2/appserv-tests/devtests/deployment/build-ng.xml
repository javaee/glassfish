    This ant script runs TestNG to manage tests in a GlassFish deployment devtest
    directory.  Note that this script expects:
 
    -  Environment variables:
        APS_HOME should point to the GlassFish appserv-tests directory
        JAVA_HOME should point to the JDK to be used for testing
        
    - The TestNG jar file be placed at ${APS_HOME}/lib with the name testng.jar.  
    In the near future the TestNG jar may become available from the GlassFish 
    site.  Until then testers who wish to use it should download it themselves
    from http://www.testng.org and copy the jar file from that download as 
    testng.jar into ${APS_HOME}/lib.
    
    -  One or more Java classes of any name exist at the lowest-level test
    directory.  (For example, such a directory is ejb30/ear/session.)  These 
    classes are required to use the TestNG annotations to identify and
    describe the test methods to be run.  They must also (temporarily at least)
    reside in a package that ends with .testng so the testng task below can
    efficiently select which .class files to check for TestNG annotations.

    Such classes may extend DeploymentTest (in the GlassFish repository at 
    ${APS_HOME}/devtests/deployment/DeploymentTest.java) if they wish but 
    they are not required to do so.
    
    To use TestNG to run such tests, cd to the lower-level test directory
    of interest and invoke ant specifying this file.  
    
    Note that this script and the test classes are fairly simple and will 
    likely evolve and improve over time.

    various ant jars need to be in the class path.  Also, the devtests 
    require compilation of Java files, so tools.jar must be in the classpath
    for the compiler to be found when ant is invoked from the TestNG test.
